Likewise, his cosmopolitan aspirations made him an advocate of peace and of the brotherhood of nations. In his will he also included literature, although he placed it after the sciences, to which he felt most drawn.\nLiterature is grateful to him that its practitioners have also been the object of his solicitude; one could argue that it comes last in the group of Swedish prizes for the very sound reason that the supreme flower of civilization, perhaps most beautiful yet also most delicate, will now bloom on the firm ground of reality.\nIn any event, the laureates receive in these floral tributes of modern times a recompense surpassing in material value the golden violets of a past era.\nThe award of the Nobel Prize in Literature poses its own problems. «Literature» is a very inclusive term and the statutes of the Nobel Foundation rightly specify that the competition must include not only belles-lettres but also works which, by their form as well as by their exposition, have literary value. But thereby the field is expanded and the difficulties are compounded. If it is difficult to decide – supposing that the merits of the proposed authors otherwise are approximately equal – whether the Prize should be granted to a lyric, an epic, or a dramatic poet, the task is complicated even more if it becomes a matter of choosing among an eminent historian, a great philosopher, and a poet of genius. The dimensions become, as the mathematicians say, incommensurable. But one may be consoled with the thought that, since the Prize is an annual one, more than one writer of merit who has to yield his place to another equally great, may be able to receive some other year the award he deserves.\nNumerous and excellent recommendations for the literary Prize have reached the Swedish Academy. It has submitted them to the most scrupulous examination and in its choice among different names of universal reputation and almost equal literary importance, it has decided on one which it believed should have priority this time from several points of view. It has awarded the first Nobel Prize in Literature to the poet and philosopher Sully Prudhomme of the French Academy.\nSully Prudhomme was born March 16, 1839, and in 1865 emerged as an accomplished poet in his\nStances et Poèmes\n[Stanzas and Poems]. This volume was followed by several others of verse, philosophy, and aesthetics. If the imagination of other poets is primarily turned outward and reflects the life and the world surrounding us, Sully Prudhomme has an introvert nature as sensitive as it is delicate. His poetry is rarely concerned with images and exterior situations as such, but principally with the extent to which they can serve as a mirror of poetic contemplation. The love of the spiritual, his doubts, his sorrows, which nothing earthly can dissipate, are the usual subjects of his work which, in its finished form and sculptural beauty, suffers no useless word. His poetry appears in exuberant colours and only rarely takes on the character of melodious music; but it is all the more plastic in the creation of forms suited to expressing feelings and ideas. Noble, profoundly pensive, and turned toward sadness, his soul reveals itself in this poetry, tender yet not sentimental – a sorrowful analysis which inspires a melancholy sympathy in the reader.\nThrough the charm of his exquisite diction and through his consummate art, Sully Prudhomme is one of the major poets of our time, and some of his poems are pearls of imperishable value. The Swedish Academy has been less attracted by his didactic or abstract poems than by his smaller lyric compositions, which are full of feeling and contemplation, and which charm by their nobility and dignity and by the extremely rare union of delicate reflection and rich sentiment.\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to emphasize one characteristic. Sully Prudhomme’s work reveals an inquiring and observing mind which finds no rest in what passes and which, as it seems impossible to him to know more, finds evidence of man’s supernatural destiny in the moral realm, in the voice of conscience, and in the lofty and undeniable prescriptions of duty. From this point of view, Sully Prudhomme represents better than most writers what the testator called «an idealistic tendency» in literature. Thus the Academy believed it was acting in the spirit of Nobel’s will when, for the first time it awarded the Prize, it gave its approval, among so many illustrious men of letters, to Sully Prudhomme.\nAs the laureate has agreed to accept this distinction but is unfortunately prevented by illness from being in our midst today, I have the honour to ask the Minister of France to receive the Prize and to present it to him in the name of the Swedish Academy.\nAt the banquet, C.D. af Wirsén addressed himself to the Minister of France and asked him to convey the homage intended for the French poet who has combined, to such a notable degree, the best qualities of the heart and the mind. Also, he asked the Minister to present to the French Academy greetings from her younger Swedish sister, who was proud to be able to send from the country of Tegnér and Geijer testimony of esteem to the country which had witnessed the births of Racine, Corneille, and Victor Hugo. The Minister of France, Mr. Marchand, answered in a lively and spirited speech.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

This definition sanctions the   award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to philosophers, writers   on religious subjects, scientists, and historians, provided that   their work is distinguished by artistic excellence of   presentation as well as by the high value of its content.\nThe Swedish Academy this year had to make its choice among many   brilliant names that have been suggested. In giving the Prize to   the historian Theodor Mommsen, whose name had been proposed by   eighteen members of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, it   has selected one of the most celebrated among them.\nA bibliography of Mommsen’s published writings, compiled by   Zangemeister on the occasion of his seventieth birthday, contains   nine hundred and twenty items. One of Mommsen’s most important   projects was editing the\nCorpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\n(1867-1959), a Herculean task despite the assistance of many   learned collaborators, for not only did Mommsen contribute to   each of the fifteen volumes but the organization of the total   work is his lasting achievement. A veritable hero in the field of   scholarship, Mommsen has done original and seminal research in   Roman law, epigraphy, numismatics, the chronology of Roman   history, and general Roman history. Even an otherwise prejudiced   critic admitted that he can speak with equal authority on an   Iapygian inscription, a fragment of Appius Caecus, and   agriculture in Carthage. The educated public knows him chiefly   through his\nRömische Geschichte\n(1854-55, 1885)   [\nHistory of Rome\n], and it is this monumental work in   particular that induced the Swedish Academy to award the Nobel   Prize to him.\nThe work began to appear in 1854; Volume IV has not yet been   published, but in 1885 he brought out Volume V, a masterly   description of the state of the provinces under the Empire, a   period so close to our own that the descriptions could be made to   apply to more recent fields of activity which are mentioned in   the Nobel statutes and which one can use as a starting point in   assessing the total work of the writer. Mommsen’s\nRömische Geschichte\n, which has been translated into   many languages, is distinguished by its thorough and   comprehensive scholarship as well as its vigorous and lively   style. Mommsen combines his command of the vast material with   acute judgment, strict method, a youthful vigour, and that   artistic presentation which alone can give life and concreteness   to a description. He knows how to separate the wheat from the   chaff, and it is difficult to decide whether one should give   higher praise and have more admiration for his vast knowledge and   the organizing power of his mind or for his intuitive imagination   and his ability to turn carefully investigated facts into a   living picture. His intuition and his creative power bridge the   gap between the historian and the poet. Mommsen felt this   relationship when in the fifth volume of his Roman history he   said that imagination is the mother not only of poetry but also   of history. Indeed, the similarities are great. Ranke’s detached   objectivity is reminiscent of Goethe’s calm greatness, and   England did right in burying Macaulay in the poets’ corner of   Westminster Abbey.\nIn a few bold strokes Mommsen has drawn the character of the   Roman people and shown how the Roman’s obedience to the state was   linked to the obedience of son to father. With extraordinary   skill he has unrolled the huge canvas of Rome’s development from   slight beginnings to world rule. He has shown how with the growth   of the Empire new tasks outgrew the old and stubbornly preserved   constitution; how the sovereignty of the comitia gradually became   a fiction, only incidentally realized by demagogues for their own   purposes; how the Senate took care of public affairs in an   honourable manner, but how the old aristocratic oligarchy that   had once served its purpose failed to meet new demands; how a   frequently unpatriotic capitalism abused its powers in political   speculations; and how the disappearance of the free peasant led   to disastrous consequences for the commonwealth. Mommsen also has   demonstrated how the frequent change of consuls hampered the   unified and consistent conduct of wars, which led to the   prolongation of military commands; how at the same time the   generals became increasingly independent and how Caesarism became   a necessity for many reasons but especially because of the lack   of institutions commensurate with the needs of the actual Empire;   and how absolutism in many cases would have caused less hardship   than the oligarchic rule. False grandeur vanishes before the   uncompromising eye of the historian, the wheat is separated from   the chaff and, like his admired Caesar, Mommsen has a clear eye   for practical needs and that freedom from illusions which he   praised in the conquerors of Gaul.\nVarious critics have objected that Mommsen is sometimes carried   away by his genius for subjective passionate judgments,   especially in his frequently unfavourable remarks concerning the   last partisans of dying freedom and the opponents of Caesar, and   concerning those who wavered between the parties during those   hard times. Objections, perhaps not always totally unjustified,   have been raised to Mommsen’s admiration of the power of genius   even where it breaks the law, as well as to his statement that in   history, which has no trials for high treason, a revolutionary   can be a farsighted and praiseworthy statesman. On the other   hand, it must be emphasized that Mommsen never glorifies brute   power, but extols that power which serves the high goals of the   state; and one has to record his firmly stated conviction that   «praise that is corrupted by the genius of evil sins against   the sacred spirit of history.» It has also been remarked   that Mommsen occasionally applies to ancient conditions modern   terms that cannot fully correspond to them (\nJunkertum\n, the   Roman Coblenz,\nCamarilla\n,\nLanzknechte\n,\nMarschälle\n,\nSbirren\n, etc.). But this method of   stressing the similarities between historical phenomena of   different ages is not a product of Mommsen’s imagination but of   his learning, which has at its disposal many analogues from   various periods of history. If it adds too much colour to the   narrative, it also adds freshness. Mommsen, by the way, is not a   historical materialist. He admires Polybius, but he blames him   for overlooking the ethical powers of man, and for having a too   mechanical\nWeltanschauung\n. Concerning C. Gracchus, the   inspired revolutionary whose measures he sometimes praises and   sometimes blames, he says that every state is built on sand   unless the ruler and the governed are tied together by a common   morality. A healthy family life is to him the core of the nation.   He severely condemns the curse of the Roman system of slavery. He   has seen how a people that still has energy can be morally   strengthened by disaster, and there is a pedagogical truth in his   words that just as Athens’ freedom was born out of the flames   with which the Persians ravaged the Acropolis, so today the unity   of Italy resulted from the conflagration that the Gauls caused in   Rome.\nLearned, lively, sarcastic, and versatile, Mommsen has shed light   on the domestic and foreign affairs of Rome, her religion,   literature, law, finances, and customs. His descriptions are   magnificent; no reader can forget his accounts of the battles of   Lake Trasimene, Cannae, Aleria, and Pharsalus. His character   sketches are equally lively. In sharp and clear outlines we see   the profiles of the «political incendiary» C. Gracchus;   of Marius in his last period «when insanity became a power   and one plunged into abysses to avoid giddiness »; of Sulla,   in particular, an incomparable portrait that has become an   anthology piece; of the great Julius Caesar, Mommsen’s Roman   ideal; of Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, the victor of Zama – not to   mention the lesser figures whose features have been drawn clearly   by the master’s hand.\nWith regard to these portraits the historian Treitschke has said   that\nRömische Geschichte\nis the finest historical   work of the nineteenth century and that Mommsen’s Caesar and   Hannibal must cause enthusiasm in every young man, every young   soldier.\nOne finds in Mommsen a curious combination of qualities. He is   profoundly learned, a sober analyst of sources; yet he can be   passionate in his judgments. He describes in great detail and   with profound knowledge the inner workings of government and the   complexities of economics; but at the same time his battle scenes   and character sketches are brilliant. He is perhaps above all an   artist, and his\nRömische Geschichte\nis a gigantic   work of art. Belles-lettres, that noble flower of civilization,   receives the last mention in Nobel’s will; Mommsen will always be   counted among its prime representatives. When he delivered the   first volume of his\nRömische Geschichte\nto the   publisher, he wrote, «the labour has been immense», and   on the fiftieth anniversary of his doctorate he spoke fervently   of the boundless ocean of scholarship. But in his completed work   the labour, however great it may have been, has been obliterated   as in any true work of art which receives its own form from   nature. The reader treads on safe ground, unmolested by the surf.   The great work stands before our eyes as if cast in metal. In his   inaugural address in Cambridge, Lord Acton justly called Mommsen   one of the greatest writers of the present, and from this point   of view especially Mommsen deserves a great\nliterary\nprize. The most recent German edition of\nRömische   Geschichte\nhas just appeared. There are no changes. The work   has retained its freshness; it is a monument which, though it may   not possess the soft beauty of marble, is as perennial as bronze.   The scholar’s hand is visible everywhere, but so is the poet’s.   And, indeed, Mommsen did write poetry in his youth. The\nLiederbuch dreier Freunde\n[\nSongbook of Three   Friends\n] of 1843 is witness that he might have become a   servant of the Muses if, in his own words, circumstances had not   brought it about that «what with folios and with prose/not   every bud turned out a rose». Mommsen the historian was a   friend of Theodor Storm and an admirer of Mörike; even in   advanced years he translated works by the Italian poets Carducci   and Giacosa.\nArts and Sciences have often shown the capacity to keep their   practitioners young in spirit. Mommsen is both a scholar and an   artist, and at eighty-five he is young in his works. Even in old   age, as late as 1895, he made valuable contributions to the   Proceedings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.\nThe medal of the Nobel Prize in Literature depicts a young man   listening to the inspirations of the Muses. Mommsen is an old   man, but he possesses the fire of youth, and one rarely realizes   as clearly as when reading Mommsen’s\nRömische   Geschichte\nthat Clio was one of the Muses. That example of   pure history aroused our enthusiasm when we were young; it has   kept its power over our minds, as we learn when we reread it now   in our older days. Such is the power of historical scholarship if   it is combined with great art.\nFor the above reasons we are sending today a homage from the   country of Erik Gustaf Geijer to Theodor Mommsen.\nAt the banquet, C.D. af Wirsén   delivered a speech in German in which he praised «the master   of the art of historical exposition», and, in the name of   the Swedish Academy, invited those present to empty their glasses   in honour of the «great master of German historical   research».

The Academy thinks that this year it   should give priority to the poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.   Although we have the pleasure of seeing the illustrious laureate   at this ceremony, custom requires that I speak of him in the   third person as I give an account of the Academy’s decision. But   I reserve the right to address a few personal remarks to him at   the end.\nBjørnstjerne Bjørnson is so generally known and his   works are so familiar to educated Swedes that it is unnecessary   to give a comprehensive appreciation of his universally and   gladly acknowledged merits. Therefore I shall limit myself on   this solemn occasion to the following remarks.\nThe poet to whom with true satisfaction the Swedish Academy has   awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature was born at Kvikne, Norway,   where his father was a minister and where as a child he could   listen to the waters of the Orkla boiling at the bottom of a   gorge. The last years of his childhood were, however, spent at   Naesset in the beautiful valley of Romsdal where his father had   been transferred. The vicarage of Naesset is situated between the   two inlets of Langfjord, Eidsvaag and Eirisfjord. In that   picturesque countryside of Norway, between these two fjords, the   young boy often looked at the splendour of the sun setting behind   the mountain or in the sea. There he learned to do farmwork. His   love of the rustic nature of his country and his intimate   knowledge of the life of the people date from that time. At the   age of eleven he was sent to school at Molde. He did not do   brilliantly, but the development of a great poet is not always   measured by such standards. During his studies he came across one   author who was to have a profound influence on his life: he began   to read Sturleson. At this period, too, he became acquainted with   the stories of Asbjørnson and the works of   Oehlenschläger and Walter Scott. At the age of seventeen he   went to Christiania (Oslo) to prepare for his baccalaureate,   which he passed in 1852. Bjørnson has said that he knew of   his poetic vocation after he took part in the First Student   Assembly in Uppsala in 1856. In unforgettable words he has given   us his impressions of the church of Riddarholm lit up by the rays   of the setting sun, and of Stockholm in the splendour of the   summer. Then he wrote\nMellem slagene\n(1857) [Between the   Battles] in a fortnight, to be followed by other works, among   them the story\nSynnøve Solbakken\n(1857) [\nSunny   Hill\n]. Henceforth the reputation of Bjørnson was solidly   established and an uninterrupted series of new works spread his   name all over the world.\nBjørnson is a great epic and dramatic writer, but he is also   a great lyric poet.\nSynnøve Solbakken\n,\nArne\n(1858), and\nEn glad gut\n(1860) [\nA Happy Boy\n] put   him in the first rank of painters of contemporary life. In these   sombre accounts he reveals himself as a man of the country and of   the old saga; indeed it has been said, not without reason, that   he describes the life of the peasant in the light of saga. But it   should be added that the peasants whom he knew so well since his   Romsdal days have – in the judgments of competent persons –   preserved the laconic and reserved manner of talking which the   poet has reproduced with such felicity. Although this   reproduction is idealized and profoundly poetic, it is   nonetheless faithful and true to nature.\nAs a dramatist Bjørnson has treated historical subjects,   e.g.\nKong Sverre\n(1861),\nSigurd Jorsalafar\n(1872)   [Sigurd the Crusader], the masterly\nSigurd Slembe\n(1862)   [Sigurd the Bad], in which the love of Audhild brings some light   into a sombre situation and where the figure of Finnepigen stands   in the splendour of an aurora borealis, the passionate drama\nMaria Stuart i Shotland\n(1864), and other creations of   genius. But he has been equally successful in his choice of   contemporary subjects, as in\nRedaktøren\n(1874)   [\nThe Editor\n],\nEn fallit\n(1874) [\nThe   Bankrupt\n], etc. Even as an old man he has created a   disinterested portrait of love in\nPaul Lange og Tora   Parsberg\n(1898); in\nLaboremus\n(1901) he has extolled   the right of the moral life against the natural forces of   unrestrained passion. Finally, in\nPå Storhove\n(1902)   [At Storhove] he has paid dramatic homage to the guardian forces   of the home as represented by Margareta, the faithful and   constant support of her family. It should in fact be observed   that Bjørnson’s characters are of a rare purity, that his   genius is always positive and in no way negative. His works are   never adulterated; on the contrary they are pure metal, and   whatever modifications the years and experience have imposed upon   his point of view and that of others, he has never ceased to   combat the claim of the senses to dominate man.\nIt is sometimes said that the Nobel Prize in Literature, designed   for the best literary work, should preferably be awarded to young   writers. That may be true, but even so the Academy believes it   has met all reasonable demands.\nThe creative power of this man of seventy-one is so great that he   published\nPå Storhove\nin 1902, and the works   published afterward bear witness to the youthful spirit that he   has been able to preserve.\nAs a lyric poet Bjørnson is exemplary by his fresh   simplicity and his profound sentiments. His poems are an   inspirational source of inexhaustible wealth, and the melodious   character of his verse has tempted many a composer to set it to   music… No country has a more beautiful anthem than «Ja, vi   elsker dette Landet» [Yes, we love this country] by   Bjørnson, and when one eads the sublime song of«Arnljot   Gelline», in which the rhythms are like the majestic   movements of waves, one likes to think that in future times the   waves of memory will murmur «i store maaneskinsklare   Naetter» [in clear moon-lit nights] as they play the name of   the great national poet on the coasts of Norway.\nMr. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson – Your genius has served the   purest and most elevated ideas; it has put the highest demands on   human life, in certain cases (\nEn hanske\n, 1883 [\nA   Gauntlet\n] ) even thought too high by many. But in their noble   severity they are infinitely preferable to the laxness that is   all too prevalent in the literature of our day. Your inspired and   universally cknowledged poetic achievement, rooted in nature and   in the life of the people as well as in strong personal   convictions, combines morality and a healthy poetic freshness.   Hence the Swedish Academy has seen fit to render homage to your   illustrious genius by awarding you the Nobel Prize for this year,   and it respectfully asks His Majesty the King to deign to give   you this proof of its admiration.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Thus there cannot be any hesitation in   choosing between a talent in process of formation and a proven   genius at the end of his development. The jury does not have the   right to ignore a still active author of European fame, merely   because he is old. The works of an old writer are often proof of   a unique and youthful energy. The Swedish Academy therefore was   right to render homage to\nMommsen\nand\nBjørnson\nin awarding them Nobel   Prizes even at a time when both were past their prime. In making   its choice among the candidates proposed this year for the Nobel   Prize, the Academy has again given its attention to several   literary veterans of recognized fame, and it has wished to renew   its pledge to genius held in high esteem in the literary   world.\nThe Academy has thought particularly of two authors who would   both have been worthy of the whole Nobel Prize. Both have   attained the final limits not only of the poetic art, but even of   human life; one is seventy-four years old, the other two years   younger. Therefore the Academy believes it should not wait longer   to confer on them a distinction they both equally merit, although   from different points of view, and it has awarded half the annual   Prize to each. If the material value of the award is thus   diminished for each of the laureates, the Academy nonetheless   wishes to state publicly that, in this particular case, it   considers each of these two Prizes as the equivalent of the whole   Prize.\nI\nThe Academy has given one of the awards to   the poet Frédéric Mistral. In the freshness of his   poetic inspiration this venerable old man is younger than most of   the poets of our time. One of his principal works,\nLou   pouèmo dóu rose\n[\nThe Song of the Rhone\n], was   published not long ago, in 1897, and when the Provençal   poets celebrated their fiftieth anniversary on May 31, 1904,   Mistral tuned his lyre for a poetry that in verve and vigour does   not yield to any of his previous works.\nMistral was born on September 8, 1830, in the village of Maiano   (in French, Maillane), which is situated midway between Avignon   and Arles in the Rhone Valley. He grew up in this magnificent   natural setting among the countryfolk and soon became familiar   with their work. His father, François Mistral, was a   well-to-do farmer, devoted to the customs of his faith and of his   ancestors. His mother nursed the soul of the child with the songs   and traditions of his birthplace.\nDuring his studies at the College of Avignon, the young boy   learned the works of Homer and Virgil, which made a profound   impression on him, and one of his professors, the poet   Roumanille, inspired in him a deep love for his maternal   language, Provençal.\nAccording to the wish of his father, Frédéric Mistral   took a law degree at Aix-en-Provence; after that he was left free   to choose his career as he pleased. His choice was soon made. He   devoted himself to poetry and painted the beauties of Provence in   the idiom of the country, an idiom which he was the first to   raise to the rank of a literary language.\nHis first attempt was a long poem about rustic life; then he   published poems in a collection entitled\nLi   Prouvençalo\n(1852). After that he spent seven   consecutive years on the work that established his universal   fame,\nMirèio\n(1859).\nThe action of this poem is very simple. A good and attractive   peasant girl cannot marry a poor young man whom she loves because   her father refuses his consent. In despair she flees from the   paternal home and goes to seek succour at the church on the site   of the pilgrimage of the Three Saint Marys on the island of   Camargue in the Rhone delta. The author recounts in charming   fashion the youthful love of the young people and retraces with   masterly hand how Mirèio rushes across the rocky plains of   the Crau. Smitten by a sunstroke in the torrid Camargue, the   unfortunate young girl crawls to the chapel of the pilgrimage   site to die. There, in a vision, the three Marys appear to her at   the very instant in which she breathes her last.\nThe value of this work is not in the subject nor in the   imagination displayed in it, no matter how interesting the figure   of Mirèio may be. It lies in the art of linking together the   episodes of the story and of unreeling before our eyes all   Provence with its scenery, its memories, its ancient customs, and   the daily life of its inhabitants. Mistral says that he sings   only for the shepherds and the country people; he does so with   Homeric simplicity. He is, indeed, by his own admission, a   student of the great Homer. But far from imitating him slavishly,   he gives proof of a very personal originality in his descriptive   technique. A breath of the Golden Age animates a number of his   descriptions. How can one forget his paintings of the white   horses of the Camargue? Galloping, with manes flying in the wind,   they seem to have been touched by Neptune’s trident and set free   from the sea god’s chariot. If you remove them from their beloved   pastures at the edge of the sea, they always escape in the end.   Even after long years of absence, they return to the well-known   plains which they salute with their joyous neighing as they hear   again the breaking of the waves on the shore.\nThe rhythm of this poem has beauty and harmony, and its artistic   composition succeeds on all counts. The source from which Mistral   has drawn is not psychology; it is nature. Man himself is treated   purely as a child of nature. Let other poets sound the depths of   the human soul! Mirèio is a half-opened rose, still all   shining from the rosy light of dawn. This is the spontaneous work   of an original spirit and not the fruit of purely reflective   labour.\nThe poem was greeted with enthusiasm from its first appearance.   Lamartine, worn out with personal cares but always smitten by   beautiful poetic works, wrote «A great poet is born!»   He compared Mistral’s poem to one of the islands of an   archipelago, to a floating Delos which must have detached itself   from its group in order to join, in silence, the fragrant   Provence. He applied to Mistral these words of Virgil: «Tu   Marcellus eris!»\nSeven years after the publication of\nMirèio\n, Mistral   published a second work of equal dimensions,\nCalendau\n(1867). It has been said that the action f this poem is too   fantastic and improbable. But it matches its predecessor in the   charm of its descriptions. How could one question the grandeur of   its ideas about the ennoblement of man through trial? While\nMirèio\ncelebrates peasant life,\nCalendau\npresents a gripping picture of the sea and the forests. It is   like a brilliant glistening of water in several remarkably   precise scenes about the life of the fisherman.\nMistral is not only an epic poet; he is also a great lyricist.   His collection,\nLis Isclo d’or\n(1876) [\nIslands of   Gold\n], contains some poems of an immortal beauty. Suffice it   to recall the stanzas on the drum of Arcole, on the dying mower,   on the chateau of Roumanin with its memories of the times of the   troubadours that seem to evoke the splendour of the sunsets, or,   agair, the beautiful mystic chant that should be spoken in the   veiled twilight of the evening, «la coumunioun di   sant».\nIn other lyric poems Mistral insists with fervour on the rights   of neo-Provençal to an independent existence and seeks to   protect it against all attempts to neglect or discredit it.\nThe poem in the form of a short story, «Nerto» (1884),   offers many beautiful pages for the reader’s admiration. But the   epic narrative,\nLou pouèmo dóu Rose\n, is more   profound. Composed by a poet of sixty-seven years, it is still   full of life, and its numerous vignettes of the regions washed by   the Rhone are most engaging. What a superb type is that proud and   devout captain of the ship\nAprau\n, who thinks that one must   be a sailor to know how to pray! Another ravishing little scene   shows us the pilot’s daughter, Anglora, whose imagination has   been fed on old legends. One night she imagines that she has seen   Lou Dra, the god of the river, in the moonlit waves of the Rhone   and that she has been touched by him. The very verses here seem   to stream and sparkle in the moonlight.\nIn short, Mistral’s works are all lofty monuments to the glory of   his beloved Provence.\nThis year is a year of celebration for him. Fifty years ago on   St. Estelle’s day he founded, together with six literary friends,   the Association of Provençal Poets, whose goal was to purify   and give a definitive form to the Provençal language. The   language which is spoken from St. Remy to Arles and, without   significant differences, in all the Rhone Valley from Orange to   Martigues, served as a basis for a new literary language, as   earlier the Florentine dialect had served to form Italian.   Experts such as Gaston Paris and Koschwitz tell us that this   movement was not at all retrograde. It did not seek to restore to   life the old Provençal, but on the basis of dialects in use   among the people, it attempted to create a national language   understood by all. The efforts of the Provençal poets have   not been slow to be crowned with success. In his great   neo-Provençal dictionary,\nTresor dóu   Félibrige\n(1879-1886), a giant work on which he has   worked for more than twenty years, Mistral has recorded the   wealth of the Provençal dialects and built an imperishable   monument to the\nlengo d’O\n.\nIt goes without saying that a man like Mistral has received all   kinds of honours. The French Academy has awarded him a prize four   times. The Institute of France gave him the Reynaud prize of   10,000 francs for his dictionary. The universities of Halle and   Bonn have conferred honorary doctorates on him. Several of his   poems have been translated into various foreign languages.   Mirèio has been set to music by Gounod, and\nCalendau\nby the composer Maréchal.\nOne knows the motto given by Mistral to the Association of   Provençal Poets: «Lou soulèu me fai canta»   («The sun makes me sing»). His poems have, in effect,   spread the light of the Provençal sun in many countries,   even in Northern regions where they have made many hearts   rejoice.\nAlfred Nobel demanded idealism from an author to be judged worthy   of the Prize he established. Is it not amply found in a poet   whose work, like that of Mistral, is distinguished by a healthy   and flourishing artistic idealism; in a man who has devoted his   entire life to an ideal, the restoration and development of the   spiritual interests of his native country, its language and its   literature ?\nII\nAfter the splendour of the Greek theatre,   it is principally among the English and the Spanish that a   national dramatic art has developed. To understand modern Spanish   drama, it is necessary to know what conditions in the life of   past periods lie behind it. For a long time Spanish drama has   displayed sharp contrasts. On the one hand, there is the most   luxurious flowering of fantasy; on the other, an extremely subtle   and at times conventional casuistry. In one place, there is   brilliant colouring, and in another, a great affection for   rhetorical antithesis. Emphatic language is coupled with tangled   intrigue. Striking effects are violent, the lyric order intense.   Disharmonies are sharp, and conflicts almost always have a tragic   resolution. Dialectic is vigorous. However, interior life is very   rich, and the severe, inflexibly applied dictates of honour do   not exclude the luxury of sudden expressions of fantasy. In   Spanish drama the artificial has managed to become fused with a   genuine originality.\nThe heir and continuator of these glorious and characteristic   traditions is the writer who has been awarded half of the Nobel   Prize this year. A son of the modern age and perfectly   independent in his judgments, he has not the same conception of   the world Calderón had. Loving liberty and having fought   often for tolerance, he is no friend of despotism or of   hierarchy, but still there is in him the same exotic ardour and   the same dignity which from oldest times have been the   distinctive marks of Spanish dramatists. This writer is José   de Echegaray. Like his forebears, he knows how to present   conflict, is extremely moving and vitally interested in different   temperaments and ideals, and like them he enjoys studying the   most complicated cases of conscience. He is complete master of   the art of producing in the audience pity and fear, the   well-known fundamental effects of tragedy. Just as in the masters   of the old Spanish drama, there is in him a striking union of the   most lively imagination and the most refined artistic sense. For   this it can be said of him – as a critic otherwise unsympathetic   to him declared – «that he is of pure Spanish breed».   However, his conception of the world is vast. His sense of duty   has been purified, his fundamental conceptions are benevolent,   and his moral heroism, while retaining a peculiar national   character, has the features of a universal humanity.\nJosé de Echegaray was born in Madrid in 1833 but spent his   childhood years in Murcia, where his father held the chair of   Greek Studies at the Institute. Receiving his bachelor’s degree   at fourteen, he soon entered the School of Civil Engineering,   where he distinguished himself by his zealous application and his   penetrating skill. Five years later, in 1853, he completed his   engineering career after having compiled a most brilliant record.   Mathematics and mechanics had been his favourite studies, and his   singular understanding of these branches of learning enabled him,   after one year, to be appointed a professor in the very school   which he had so recently attended as a student. It appears that   for some years his struggle for existence was quite hard, and he   had to give private lessons in order to sustain the most modest   way of life. In spite of everything, he soon became an eminent   professor, distinguishing himself both in pure and applied   mathematics, and became an outstanding engineer. At the same time   he energetically studied political economy, embracing the ideas   of free trade. Soon, that great talent, that vivacious engineer,   was called to the highest and greatest tasks. Three times he has   been a minister of his country’s government. According to those   who know him, whether they were adversaries or friends, he has   always shown a singular skill in the administration of public   finance and public works.\nWe can easily understand the general astonishment when this   scholar, who had published treatises on analytic geometry,   physics, and electricity, dedicated his indefatigable energy to   writing for the theatre. It has been said that his creations for   the stage had the form of equations and problems. If the new   manifestation of his genius was enthusiastically acclaimed by   numerous admirers, it also found severe critics. Nevertheless, no   one could deny that his works were distinguished by a deep moral   sense. In a way, the critics were not mistaken who maintained   that in his dramas, following the example of some surgeons, he   rarely used any other method than that of «urere et   secare»; still, however, there is something to admire in   this Muse of romantic exaltation and austere severity which   condemns any compromise with duty.\nDespising the transient approval of fashion and listening only to   the inspirations of his genius, Echegaray pursued his triumphal   career, demonstrating a dramatic fecundity which makes us think   of Lope de Vega and Calderón.\nEven in his youth, when he was attending the School of Civil   Engineering, he was enthusiastic about drama and used his savings   to obtain theatre tickets. In 1865 he wrote a play entitled\nLa   hija natural\n[The Illegitimate Daughter], which was followed   by\nEl libro talonario\n[Book of Accounts] in 1874. The   playbill carried a pseudonym instead of the author’s name, but it   did not take the public long to guess that the acclaimed   dramatist was Echegaray, then Spain’s Minister of Finance. Some   months later\nLa última noche\n[The Last Night] was   staged, and since then his fertile imagination has not stopped   engendering ever-new creations. He works with such speed that in   one year he has published three or four works. Since lack of time   prohibits a complete review here of all of his productions,   suffice it to make brief mention of some which have won general   attention. Echegaray scored his first triumph in November, 1874,   with the drama\nLa esposa del vengador\n[The Avenger’s   Wife], in which his true genius was revealed and in which, side   by side with certain exaggerations, the greatest beauties can be   admired. The public could imagine that it had been taken back to   the Golden Age of Spanish drama, and it saluted Echegaray as the   regenerator of the most brilliant era of the nation’s dramatic   poetry.\nEn el puño de la espada\n[The Sword’s Handle],   presented the following year, was received with the same   applause. The sublime power that is manifest in this noble   conception so moved the many spectators that the applause did not   stop with the performance, and, after the last act, Echegaray had   to appear on stage seven times to receive the acclaim of the   audience. But great controversies arose in 1878 when, in\nEn el   pilar y en la cruz\n[The Stake and the Cross], the poet showed   himself the defender of free thought against intolerance, of   humanity against fanaticism. Typical of Echegaray, as he himself   has observed, is his\nConflicto entre dos deberes\n[Conflict   of Duties], which was presented in 1882. A conflict of duties is   found in almost all of his dramas, but rarely has the conflict   been pushed to such an extreme as in this piece. Two other dramas   have made his name famous. These two inspired, excellent plays   are\nO locura ó santidad\n[\nMadman or Saint\n] and\nEl gran Galeoto\n[\nGreat Galeoto\n], the former   presented in January, 1877, and the latter in March, 1881. In\nO locura ó santidad\nthere is a great wealth of ideas   and profound genius. It shows a man who, moved by his   righteousness to sacrifice his prosperity and worldly goods, is   considered crazy and treated as such by his friends and by the   world at large. Lorenzo de Avendano renounces a name and a   fortune when he learns unexpectedly but undeniably that they do   not legally belong to him, and he persists in his resolution when   the one indisputable proof of his illegitimacy has disappeared.   Such idealism is judged madness by his family, and Lorenzo is   looked upon by everybody as a Don Quixote, stubborn and   simple-minded. The structure of the drama is firm and solid,   demonstrating that it is the work of an engineer who calculates   precisely all the elements that have gone into it, but it shows   us to a still greater degree the poet of mature creative genius.   More than an external collision, it treats the internal conflict   of an extremely sad figure. It consists of a struggle between   duty and opportunism, and Lorenzo in following the dictate of his   conscience reaches martyrdom. Experience has always shown that   very frequently he who faithfully obeys his conscience must be   prepared to bear the fate of a martyr.\nEl gran Galeoto\nmade an even greater impression. In the   first month after it opened, it went through no fewer than five   editions and inspired a national subscription to honour its   author. Because of the masterful portrayal of the psychology of   the characters the play has a lasting value. It shows the power   of slander. The most innocent trait is disfigured and   scandalously deformed by the gossip of people. Ernesto and   Teodora have nothing for which to reproach themselves, but the   world believes them guilty, and at last, abandoned by everyone,   they end by throwing themselves into one another’s arms. Subtlety   of psychological analysis is revealed with such masterly detail   of observation that those two noble spirits, in no way desirous   of stealing the right of their neighbour, become mutually   enamoured without suspecting it. They discover the fact of their   love only by means of the persecution to which they see   themselves exposed. Romanticism triumphs in this drama whose   poetic beauty is clearly perceptible, whose lyric details possess   a dazzling colouring, and whose structure is without a   flaw.\nEchegaray goes on working as a dramatist. This year (1904) he has   published a new play,\nLa desequilibrada\n[The Disturbed   Woman], whose first act is a genuine masterpiece of exposition   and individualization, and which in its entirety reveals no   weakening of poetic inspiration. In this play, we are shown Don   Mauricio de Vargas, a clear type of that chivalry so dear to   Echegaray, that chivalry which does not want to buy even its own   happiness at the cost of compromising duty.\nThus it is just that the Nobel Prize be awarded to this great   poet, whose production is distinguished by its virile energy and   whose mode of seeing is impregnated with such high ideals that   with abundant reason an eminent German critic has been able to   say of him: «Er verlangt Recht und Pflichterfüllung   unter allen Umständen.»\nEchegaray has put in the mouth of one of the characters of\nEl   gran Galeoto\nthe most pessimistic words about the world,   which «never recognizes the subtleties of the genius until   three centuries after his death».\nNo doubt this can happen. But against the general application of   the above thesis we can offer the justified admiration which the   work of Echegaray has aroused. To those tributes of appreciation   the Swedish Academy has agreed to add still one more, awarding   the Nobel Prize in homage to the celebrated poet, the honour and   glory of the Spanish Academy, José de Echegaray.\nAt the banquet, C.D. af Wirsén pointed   out that sharing in the Prize did not diminish in any way the   value of the laureates. He recalled to mind the works – pure,   limpid, and fresh – of Frédéric Mistral, naming the   principal ones and asking the Minister of France, Mr. Marchand,   to convey to the famous Provençal poet the homage which the   Swedish Academy and all those assembled took pleasure in   rendering him. The speaker then reviewed the imposing work of   Echegaray and expressed regrets for his state of health and   explained that the Minister of Spain had been prevented from   attending this banquet and from receiving the congratulations for   his famous countryman.\nThe Minister of France, Mr. Marchand, replied to the Secretary of   the Swedish Academy and recalled that in the preceding year he   had thanked them for the Prize awarded to\nMr. and Mrs. Curie\n; this   time he spoke for the great poet of whom Provence is justly   proud. He told of a most touching event. Forty-five years ago the   French Academy, which did not have at its disposal resources as   great as those with which the great Nobel had endowed the Swedish   Academy, decided, at the suggestion of Lamartine, who was   enthusiastic about Mirèio, to award the prize of 3000 francs   to Mistral. When they asked the author, who had been leading a   simple life in the country, what he would do with the Prize, he   answered, «It is a prize for poetry; it is not to be   touched!» The modest poet shared his   «overabundance» with others.\nMr. Marchand also acted as spokesman for his colleague, the   Minister of Spain, to express Mr. Echegaray’s gratitude.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Thus there cannot be any hesitation in   choosing between a talent in process of formation and a proven   genius at the end of his development. The jury does not have the   right to ignore a still active author of European fame, merely   because he is old. The works of an old writer are often proof of   a unique and youthful energy. The Swedish Academy therefore was   right to render homage to\nMommsen\nand\nBjørnson\nin awarding them Nobel   Prizes even at a time when both were past their prime. In making   its choice among the candidates proposed this year for the Nobel   Prize, the Academy has again given its attention to several   literary veterans of recognized fame, and it has wished to renew   its pledge to genius held in high esteem in the literary   world.\nThe Academy has thought particularly of two authors who would   both have been worthy of the whole Nobel Prize. Both have   attained the final limits not only of the poetic art, but even of   human life; one is seventy-four years old, the other two years   younger. Therefore the Academy believes it should not wait longer   to confer on them a distinction they both equally merit, although   from different points of view, and it has awarded half the annual   Prize to each. If the material value of the award is thus   diminished for each of the laureates, the Academy nonetheless   wishes to state publicly that, in this particular case, it   considers each of these two Prizes as the equivalent of the whole   Prize.\nI\nThe Academy has given one of the awards to   the poet Frédéric Mistral. In the freshness of his   poetic inspiration this venerable old man is younger than most of   the poets of our time. One of his principal works,\nLou   pouèmo dóu rose\n[\nThe Song of the Rhone\n], was   published not long ago, in 1897, and when the Provençal   poets celebrated their fiftieth anniversary on May 31, 1904,   Mistral tuned his lyre for a poetry that in verve and vigour does   not yield to any of his previous works.\nMistral was born on September 8, 1830, in the village of Maiano   (in French, Maillane), which is situated midway between Avignon   and Arles in the Rhone Valley. He grew up in this magnificent   natural setting among the countryfolk and soon became familiar   with their work. His father, François Mistral, was a   well-to-do farmer, devoted to the customs of his faith and of his   ancestors. His mother nursed the soul of the child with the songs   and traditions of his birthplace.\nDuring his studies at the College of Avignon, the young boy   learned the works of Homer and Virgil, which made a profound   impression on him, and one of his professors, the poet   Roumanille, inspired in him a deep love for his maternal   language, Provençal.\nAccording to the wish of his father, Frédéric Mistral   took a law degree at Aix-en-Provence; after that he was left free   to choose his career as he pleased. His choice was soon made. He   devoted himself to poetry and painted the beauties of Provence in   the idiom of the country, an idiom which he was the first to   raise to the rank of a literary language.\nHis first attempt was a long poem about rustic life; then he   published poems in a collection entitled\nLi   Prouvençalo\n(1852). After that he spent seven   consecutive years on the work that established his universal   fame,\nMirèio\n(1859).\nThe action of this poem is very simple. A good and attractive   peasant girl cannot marry a poor young man whom she loves because   her father refuses his consent. In despair she flees from the   paternal home and goes to seek succour at the church on the site   of the pilgrimage of the Three Saint Marys on the island of   Camargue in the Rhone delta. The author recounts in charming   fashion the youthful love of the young people and retraces with   masterly hand how Mirèio rushes across the rocky plains of   the Crau. Smitten by a sunstroke in the torrid Camargue, the   unfortunate young girl crawls to the chapel of the pilgrimage   site to die. There, in a vision, the three Marys appear to her at   the very instant in which she breathes her last.\nThe value of this work is not in the subject nor in the   imagination displayed in it, no matter how interesting the figure   of Mirèio may be. It lies in the art of linking together the   episodes of the story and of unreeling before our eyes all   Provence with its scenery, its memories, its ancient customs, and   the daily life of its inhabitants. Mistral says that he sings   only for the shepherds and the country people; he does so with   Homeric simplicity. He is, indeed, by his own admission, a   student of the great Homer. But far from imitating him slavishly,   he gives proof of a very personal originality in his descriptive   technique. A breath of the Golden Age animates a number of his   descriptions. How can one forget his paintings of the white   horses of the Camargue? Galloping, with manes flying in the wind,   they seem to have been touched by Neptune’s trident and set free   from the sea god’s chariot. If you remove them from their beloved   pastures at the edge of the sea, they always escape in the end.   Even after long years of absence, they return to the well-known   plains which they salute with their joyous neighing as they hear   again the breaking of the waves on the shore.\nThe rhythm of this poem has beauty and harmony, and its artistic   composition succeeds on all counts. The source from which Mistral   has drawn is not psychology; it is nature. Man himself is treated   purely as a child of nature. Let other poets sound the depths of   the human soul! Mirèio is a half-opened rose, still all   shining from the rosy light of dawn. This is the spontaneous work   of an original spirit and not the fruit of purely reflective   labour.\nThe poem was greeted with enthusiasm from its first appearance.   Lamartine, worn out with personal cares but always smitten by   beautiful poetic works, wrote «A great poet is born!»   He compared Mistral’s poem to one of the islands of an   archipelago, to a floating Delos which must have detached itself   from its group in order to join, in silence, the fragrant   Provence. He applied to Mistral these words of Virgil: «Tu   Marcellus eris!»\nSeven years after the publication of\nMirèio\n, Mistral   published a second work of equal dimensions,\nCalendau\n(1867). It has been said that the action f this poem is too   fantastic and improbable. But it matches its predecessor in the   charm of its descriptions. How could one question the grandeur of   its ideas about the ennoblement of man through trial? While\nMirèio\ncelebrates peasant life,\nCalendau\npresents a gripping picture of the sea and the forests. It is   like a brilliant glistening of water in several remarkably   precise scenes about the life of the fisherman.\nMistral is not only an epic poet; he is also a great lyricist.   His collection,\nLis Isclo d’or\n(1876) [\nIslands of   Gold\n], contains some poems of an immortal beauty. Suffice it   to recall the stanzas on the drum of Arcole, on the dying mower,   on the chateau of Roumanin with its memories of the times of the   troubadours that seem to evoke the splendour of the sunsets, or,   agair, the beautiful mystic chant that should be spoken in the   veiled twilight of the evening, «la coumunioun di   sant».\nIn other lyric poems Mistral insists with fervour on the rights   of neo-Provençal to an independent existence and seeks to   protect it against all attempts to neglect or discredit it.\nThe poem in the form of a short story, «Nerto» (1884),   offers many beautiful pages for the reader’s admiration. But the   epic narrative,\nLou pouèmo dóu Rose\n, is more   profound. Composed by a poet of sixty-seven years, it is still   full of life, and its numerous vignettes of the regions washed by   the Rhone are most engaging. What a superb type is that proud and   devout captain of the ship\nAprau\n, who thinks that one must   be a sailor to know how to pray! Another ravishing little scene   shows us the pilot’s daughter, Anglora, whose imagination has   been fed on old legends. One night she imagines that she has seen   Lou Dra, the god of the river, in the moonlit waves of the Rhone   and that she has been touched by him. The very verses here seem   to stream and sparkle in the moonlight.\nIn short, Mistral’s works are all lofty monuments to the glory of   his beloved Provence.\nThis year is a year of celebration for him. Fifty years ago on   St. Estelle’s day he founded, together with six literary friends,   the Association of Provençal Poets, whose goal was to purify   and give a definitive form to the Provençal language. The   language which is spoken from St. Remy to Arles and, without   significant differences, in all the Rhone Valley from Orange to   Martigues, served as a basis for a new literary language, as   earlier the Florentine dialect had served to form Italian.   Experts such as Gaston Paris and Koschwitz tell us that this   movement was not at all retrograde. It did not seek to restore to   life the old Provençal, but on the basis of dialects in use   among the people, it attempted to create a national language   understood by all. The efforts of the Provençal poets have   not been slow to be crowned with success. In his great   neo-Provençal dictionary,\nTresor dóu   Félibrige\n(1879-1886), a giant work on which he has   worked for more than twenty years, Mistral has recorded the   wealth of the Provençal dialects and built an imperishable   monument to the\nlengo d’O\n.\nIt goes without saying that a man like Mistral has received all   kinds of honours. The French Academy has awarded him a prize four   times. The Institute of France gave him the Reynaud prize of   10,000 francs for his dictionary. The universities of Halle and   Bonn have conferred honorary doctorates on him. Several of his   poems have been translated into various foreign languages.   Mirèio has been set to music by Gounod, and\nCalendau\nby the composer Maréchal.\nOne knows the motto given by Mistral to the Association of   Provençal Poets: «Lou soulèu me fai canta»   («The sun makes me sing»). His poems have, in effect,   spread the light of the Provençal sun in many countries,   even in Northern regions where they have made many hearts   rejoice.\nAlfred Nobel demanded idealism from an author to be judged worthy   of the Prize he established. Is it not amply found in a poet   whose work, like that of Mistral, is distinguished by a healthy   and flourishing artistic idealism; in a man who has devoted his   entire life to an ideal, the restoration and development of the   spiritual interests of his native country, its language and its   literature ?\nII\nAfter the splendour of the Greek theatre,   it is principally among the English and the Spanish that a   national dramatic art has developed. To understand modern Spanish   drama, it is necessary to know what conditions in the life of   past periods lie behind it. For a long time Spanish drama has   displayed sharp contrasts. On the one hand, there is the most   luxurious flowering of fantasy; on the other, an extremely subtle   and at times conventional casuistry. In one place, there is   brilliant colouring, and in another, a great affection for   rhetorical antithesis. Emphatic language is coupled with tangled   intrigue. Striking effects are violent, the lyric order intense.   Disharmonies are sharp, and conflicts almost always have a tragic   resolution. Dialectic is vigorous. However, interior life is very   rich, and the severe, inflexibly applied dictates of honour do   not exclude the luxury of sudden expressions of fantasy. In   Spanish drama the artificial has managed to become fused with a   genuine originality.\nThe heir and continuator of these glorious and characteristic   traditions is the writer who has been awarded half of the Nobel   Prize this year. A son of the modern age and perfectly   independent in his judgments, he has not the same conception of   the world Calderón had. Loving liberty and having fought   often for tolerance, he is no friend of despotism or of   hierarchy, but still there is in him the same exotic ardour and   the same dignity which from oldest times have been the   distinctive marks of Spanish dramatists. This writer is José   de Echegaray. Like his forebears, he knows how to present   conflict, is extremely moving and vitally interested in different   temperaments and ideals, and like them he enjoys studying the   most complicated cases of conscience. He is complete master of   the art of producing in the audience pity and fear, the   well-known fundamental effects of tragedy. Just as in the masters   of the old Spanish drama, there is in him a striking union of the   most lively imagination and the most refined artistic sense. For   this it can be said of him – as a critic otherwise unsympathetic   to him declared – «that he is of pure Spanish breed».   However, his conception of the world is vast. His sense of duty   has been purified, his fundamental conceptions are benevolent,   and his moral heroism, while retaining a peculiar national   character, has the features of a universal humanity.\nJosé de Echegaray was born in Madrid in 1833 but spent his   childhood years in Murcia, where his father held the chair of   Greek Studies at the Institute. Receiving his bachelor’s degree   at fourteen, he soon entered the School of Civil Engineering,   where he distinguished himself by his zealous application and his   penetrating skill. Five years later, in 1853, he completed his   engineering career after having compiled a most brilliant record.   Mathematics and mechanics had been his favourite studies, and his   singular understanding of these branches of learning enabled him,   after one year, to be appointed a professor in the very school   which he had so recently attended as a student. It appears that   for some years his struggle for existence was quite hard, and he   had to give private lessons in order to sustain the most modest   way of life. In spite of everything, he soon became an eminent   professor, distinguishing himself both in pure and applied   mathematics, and became an outstanding engineer. At the same time   he energetically studied political economy, embracing the ideas   of free trade. Soon, that great talent, that vivacious engineer,   was called to the highest and greatest tasks. Three times he has   been a minister of his country’s government. According to those   who know him, whether they were adversaries or friends, he has   always shown a singular skill in the administration of public   finance and public works.\nWe can easily understand the general astonishment when this   scholar, who had published treatises on analytic geometry,   physics, and electricity, dedicated his indefatigable energy to   writing for the theatre. It has been said that his creations for   the stage had the form of equations and problems. If the new   manifestation of his genius was enthusiastically acclaimed by   numerous admirers, it also found severe critics. Nevertheless, no   one could deny that his works were distinguished by a deep moral   sense. In a way, the critics were not mistaken who maintained   that in his dramas, following the example of some surgeons, he   rarely used any other method than that of «urere et   secare»; still, however, there is something to admire in   this Muse of romantic exaltation and austere severity which   condemns any compromise with duty.\nDespising the transient approval of fashion and listening only to   the inspirations of his genius, Echegaray pursued his triumphal   career, demonstrating a dramatic fecundity which makes us think   of Lope de Vega and Calderón.\nEven in his youth, when he was attending the School of Civil   Engineering, he was enthusiastic about drama and used his savings   to obtain theatre tickets. In 1865 he wrote a play entitled\nLa   hija natural\n[The Illegitimate Daughter], which was followed   by\nEl libro talonario\n[Book of Accounts] in 1874. The   playbill carried a pseudonym instead of the author’s name, but it   did not take the public long to guess that the acclaimed   dramatist was Echegaray, then Spain’s Minister of Finance. Some   months later\nLa última noche\n[The Last Night] was   staged, and since then his fertile imagination has not stopped   engendering ever-new creations. He works with such speed that in   one year he has published three or four works. Since lack of time   prohibits a complete review here of all of his productions,   suffice it to make brief mention of some which have won general   attention. Echegaray scored his first triumph in November, 1874,   with the drama\nLa esposa del vengador\n[The Avenger’s   Wife], in which his true genius was revealed and in which, side   by side with certain exaggerations, the greatest beauties can be   admired. The public could imagine that it had been taken back to   the Golden Age of Spanish drama, and it saluted Echegaray as the   regenerator of the most brilliant era of the nation’s dramatic   poetry.\nEn el puño de la espada\n[The Sword’s Handle],   presented the following year, was received with the same   applause. The sublime power that is manifest in this noble   conception so moved the many spectators that the applause did not   stop with the performance, and, after the last act, Echegaray had   to appear on stage seven times to receive the acclaim of the   audience. But great controversies arose in 1878 when, in\nEn el   pilar y en la cruz\n[The Stake and the Cross], the poet showed   himself the defender of free thought against intolerance, of   humanity against fanaticism. Typical of Echegaray, as he himself   has observed, is his\nConflicto entre dos deberes\n[Conflict   of Duties], which was presented in 1882. A conflict of duties is   found in almost all of his dramas, but rarely has the conflict   been pushed to such an extreme as in this piece. Two other dramas   have made his name famous. These two inspired, excellent plays   are\nO locura ó santidad\n[\nMadman or Saint\n] and\nEl gran Galeoto\n[\nGreat Galeoto\n], the former   presented in January, 1877, and the latter in March, 1881. In\nO locura ó santidad\nthere is a great wealth of ideas   and profound genius. It shows a man who, moved by his   righteousness to sacrifice his prosperity and worldly goods, is   considered crazy and treated as such by his friends and by the   world at large. Lorenzo de Avendano renounces a name and a   fortune when he learns unexpectedly but undeniably that they do   not legally belong to him, and he persists in his resolution when   the one indisputable proof of his illegitimacy has disappeared.   Such idealism is judged madness by his family, and Lorenzo is   looked upon by everybody as a Don Quixote, stubborn and   simple-minded. The structure of the drama is firm and solid,   demonstrating that it is the work of an engineer who calculates   precisely all the elements that have gone into it, but it shows   us to a still greater degree the poet of mature creative genius.   More than an external collision, it treats the internal conflict   of an extremely sad figure. It consists of a struggle between   duty and opportunism, and Lorenzo in following the dictate of his   conscience reaches martyrdom. Experience has always shown that   very frequently he who faithfully obeys his conscience must be   prepared to bear the fate of a martyr.\nEl gran Galeoto\nmade an even greater impression. In the   first month after it opened, it went through no fewer than five   editions and inspired a national subscription to honour its   author. Because of the masterful portrayal of the psychology of   the characters the play has a lasting value. It shows the power   of slander. The most innocent trait is disfigured and   scandalously deformed by the gossip of people. Ernesto and   Teodora have nothing for which to reproach themselves, but the   world believes them guilty, and at last, abandoned by everyone,   they end by throwing themselves into one another’s arms. Subtlety   of psychological analysis is revealed with such masterly detail   of observation that those two noble spirits, in no way desirous   of stealing the right of their neighbour, become mutually   enamoured without suspecting it. They discover the fact of their   love only by means of the persecution to which they see   themselves exposed. Romanticism triumphs in this drama whose   poetic beauty is clearly perceptible, whose lyric details possess   a dazzling colouring, and whose structure is without a   flaw.\nEchegaray goes on working as a dramatist. This year (1904) he has   published a new play,\nLa desequilibrada\n[The Disturbed   Woman], whose first act is a genuine masterpiece of exposition   and individualization, and which in its entirety reveals no   weakening of poetic inspiration. In this play, we are shown Don   Mauricio de Vargas, a clear type of that chivalry so dear to   Echegaray, that chivalry which does not want to buy even its own   happiness at the cost of compromising duty.\nThus it is just that the Nobel Prize be awarded to this great   poet, whose production is distinguished by its virile energy and   whose mode of seeing is impregnated with such high ideals that   with abundant reason an eminent German critic has been able to   say of him: «Er verlangt Recht und Pflichterfüllung   unter allen Umständen.»\nEchegaray has put in the mouth of one of the characters of\nEl   gran Galeoto\nthe most pessimistic words about the world,   which «never recognizes the subtleties of the genius until   three centuries after his death».\nNo doubt this can happen. But against the general application of   the above thesis we can offer the justified admiration which the   work of Echegaray has aroused. To those tributes of appreciation   the Swedish Academy has agreed to add still one more, awarding   the Nobel Prize in homage to the celebrated poet, the honour and   glory of the Spanish Academy, José de Echegaray.\nAt the banquet, C.D. af Wirsén pointed   out that sharing in the Prize did not diminish in any way the   value of the laureates. He recalled to mind the works – pure,   limpid, and fresh – of Frédéric Mistral, naming the   principal ones and asking the Minister of France, Mr. Marchand,   to convey to the famous Provençal poet the homage which the   Swedish Academy and all those assembled took pleasure in   rendering him. The speaker then reviewed the imposing work of   Echegaray and expressed regrets for his state of health and   explained that the Minister of Spain had been prevented from   attending this banquet and from receiving the congratulations for   his famous countryman.\nThe Minister of France, Mr. Marchand, replied to the Secretary of   the Swedish Academy and recalled that in the preceding year he   had thanked them for the Prize awarded to\nMr. and Mrs. Curie\n; this   time he spoke for the great poet of whom Provence is justly   proud. He told of a most touching event. Forty-five years ago the   French Academy, which did not have at its disposal resources as   great as those with which the great Nobel had endowed the Swedish   Academy, decided, at the suggestion of Lamartine, who was   enthusiastic about Mirèio, to award the prize of 3000 francs   to Mistral. When they asked the author, who had been leading a   simple life in the country, what he would do with the Prize, he   answered, «It is a prize for poetry; it is not to be   touched!» The modest poet shared his   «overabundance» with others.\nMr. Marchand also acted as spokesman for his colleague, the   Minister of Spain, to express Mr. Echegaray’s gratitude.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

But in   every nation there are some rare geniuses who concentrate in   themselves the spirit of the nation; they represent the national   character to the world. Although they cherish the memories of the   past of that people, they do so only to strengthen its hope for   the future. Their inspiration is deeply rooted in the past, like   the oaktree of Baublis in the desert of Lithuania, but the   branches are swayed by the winds of the day. Such a   representative of the literature and intellectual culture of a   whole people is the man to whom the Swedish Academy has this year   awarded the Nobel Prize. He is here and his name is Henryk   Sienkiewicz.\nHe was born in 1846. His youthful work\nSzkice weglem\n(1877) [Charcoal Sketches] breathes deep and tender sympathy for   the oppressed and disinherited of society. Of his other early   works one remembers especially the moving story of\nJanko   muzykant\n(1879) [\nJanko the Musician\n] and the brilliant   portrait of the\nLighthouse Keeper\n(\nLatarnik\n, 1882).   The novella\nNiewola tatarska\n(1880) [Tartar Prison] gave a   foretaste of Henryk Sienkiewicz’s future performance in the   historical novel, in which he did not show his full ability until   the appearance of his famous trilogy. Of the three volumes\nOgniem i mieczem\n[\nWith Fire and Sword\n] appeared in   1884,\nPotop\n[\nThe Deluge\n] in 1886-87, and finally\nPan Wolodyjowski\n[\nPan Michael\n] in 1888-89. The   first volume describes the revolt of the Cossacks supported by   the Tartars in 1648-49; the second deals with the Polish war   against Charles Gustave; and the third with the war against the   Turks, during which the fortress of Kamieniec was taken after a   heroic defence. The climax of\nOgniem i mieczem\nis the   description of the siege of Sbaraz and of the internal struggle   of the inflexible Jeremi Wisniowiecki, debating within himself   whether his being indubitably the most resourceful general gives   him the right to usurp supreme command. The struggle of   conscience ends in the hero’s victory over his ambition. Let us   mention in passing that in his trilogy the author has described   three sieges, that of Sbaraz, that of Czestochowa, and finally   that of Kamieniec, without ever repeating himself in his   treatment of the theme.\nPotop\ncontains many excellent   tableaux that remain in the reader’s memory. There is Kamicia, at   the beginning of the novel hardly more than an outlaw induced to   fight against his king, who under the influence of his love for a   noble woman regains the esteem that he had lost and accomplishes   a series of brilliant exploits in the service of the legal order.   Olenka, one of Sienkiewicz’ many beautiful female characters, is   ravishing in her religious faith, her incorruptible rigour, and   her devout patriotism. Even the villains in this story are   interesting. There is the sombre and masterly portrait of Prince   Janusz Radziwill, who took up arms against his country, and the   description of the banquet at which he tried to inveigle his   officers into betraying Poland. Even the traitor has his beauty,   and an English critic has drawn attention to the psychological   refinement with which Henryk Sienkiewicz shows us the prince   debating with his conscience and wilfully deluding himself into   believing that his rebellion would serve the cause of Poland.   Incapable of persisting for long in this voluntary blindness, the   prince dies of remorse vainly repressed. Even in the unreliable   and libertine Prince Boguslaw there are certain attractive traits   of personal courage, of courtly grace and cheerful insouciance.   Henryk Sienkiewicz knows people too well to present them   uniformly white or black. Another distinctive trait is   Sienkiewicz’ habit of never shutting his eyes to the faults of   his compatriots; rather he exposes them mercilessly, while he   renders justice to the abilities and courage of the enemies of   Poland. Like the old prophets of Israel he often tells his people   strong truths. Thus in his historical tableaux he blames the   excessive Polish desire for individual liberty, which frequently   led to a dissipation of energy and made impossible the sacrifice   of private interests to the public good. He upbraids the lords   for their quarrels and their unwillingness to adapt themselves to   the justifiable needs of the state. But Sienkiewicz is always a   patriot who certainly puts the brave chivalry of the Polish   people in its proper light and who emphasizes the great role   effectively played by Poland, formerly the bulwark of Christendom   against the Turks and the Tartars. This high objectivity is above   all proof of the wisdom of Sienkiewicz’ mind and his conception   of history. As a good Pole he must disapprove the attack of   Charles Gustave against Poland, but nonetheless he gives   brilliant portraits of the personal courage of the king and of   the excellent discipline and cohesion of the Swedish   troops.\nIt has often been said that\nPan Wolodyjowski\nis the   weakest part of the trilogy. We find it hard to subscribe to that   opinion. One need only remember the moving account of how the   wife of Wolodyjowski escapes from the wily Tartar Azya who   combines the qualities of serpent and lion, or the admirable   portrait of Basia herself, that beautiful and dauntless soldier   wife who combines sweetness with gaiety and courage. The last   part of the trilogy is especially rich in gentle and purely human   features, as in the beautiful and sublime scene of farewell   between Basia and Wolodyjowski, who is about to let himself be   blown up with his fort. While the victorious Turks surround the   fortress of Kamieniec, when all means of rescue have been   exhausted and disaster is imminent, husband and wife are united   during an August night in a sort of niche formed by a walled-up   gate. He comforts her and reminds her how much happiness they had   been granted together and that death is merely a transition. The   first to begin the journey to the beyond would only prepare for   the coming of the other. The episode is marvellous and   enchanting. Although it is not sentimental, it contains such a   wealth of pure and true feeling that it is difficult to read it   without emotion. The description of Wolodyjowski’s burial is   equally grandiose, though in a different manner. At the foot of   the coffin Basia, stretched out on the tiles of the church, is   overcome by grief The chaplain beats the tambourine as if he were   giving a signal of alarm and exhorts the dead hero to rise from   the catafalque and combat the enemy as before. Then, mastering   this outburst of grief, he praises the manly courage and virtues   of the dead and prays to God that in this time of extreme danger   for the country He may give rise to a liberator. At this moment   Sobieski enters the church. All eyes’ turn toward him. Seized by   prophetic enthusiasm, the priest exclaims «Salvator»   and Sobieski falls to his knees at the side of Wolodyjowski’s   bier.\nAll of these descriptions are distinguished by great historical   truthfulness. Because of Sienkiewicz’ extensive researches and   his sense of history, his characters speak and act in the style   of the period. It is significant that among the many persons who   suggested Henryk Sienkiewicz for the Nobel Prize there were   eminent historians.\nThe trilogy abounds in descriptions of nature admirable in their   freshness. Where would one find the equivalent of the very short   but unforgettable description in\nOgniem i mieczem\nof the   steppe as it awakens in the spring, when flowers rise from the   soil, insects buzz, wild geese pass over, birds sing, and wild   horses with floating manes and dilated nostrils rush away like a   whirlwind at the sight of a troop of soldiers?\nAnother remarkable trait of this grandiose trilogy is its humour.   The little knight Wolodyjowski is certainly admirably drawn, but   the portrait of the jovial nobleman Zagloba imprints itself   perhaps even more firmly in our memory. His vainglory, his girth,   and his taste for wine recall Falstaff, but these are their only   common traits. Whereas Falstaff is of a dissipated and   questionable character, Zagloba has a heart of gold; he is   faithful to his friends in times of danger. Zagloba himself   pretends to be a sober man, made to be a good priest, but in   truth he is much addicted to the pleasures of the table. He loves   wine and declares that only traitors renounce it because they are   afraid to give away their secrets when drunk; what makes him   especially abhor the Turks is the fact that they do not drink   wine. Zagloba is a terrible gossip – a quality that he considers   necessary in winter because otherwise the tongue might freeze and   become numb. He flaunts military decorations and boasts of   military exploits in which he never took part. In reality his   courage – for he has courage – is of another kind. He trembles   before every encounter like a coward, but once the battle has   begun he is seized by rage against the enemy who will not let him   live in peace and he becomes capable of true feats of courage, as   when he defeats the terrible Cossack Burlaj. Moreover, he is wily   and resourceful like Odysseus and often finds a way out when the   others have come to the end of their tether. He is basically a   debonair and emotional man, who sheds tears when some great   mishap befalls his friends. He is a good patriot and unlike so   many others he does not desert his king. It has been said that   the character of Zagloba lacks consistency because in the last   volume of the trilogy the grotesque gossip becomes more serious   and acquires more social consideration. This opinion is   inconsiderate. Sienkiewicz wanted to show us precisely how   Zagloba develops and becomes somewhat ennobled while at the same   time retaining his old faults. Such a relative improvement is all   the more natural as Zagloba despite all his bizarre faults is   basically as good as a child. Such as he is, Zagloba belongs   forever to the gallery of immortal comic characters of world   literature, and he is thoroughly original.\nThe diversity of Henryk Sienkiewicz’ talent became apparent when   in 1890 he passed from the warrior portraits of his trilogy to a   modern psychological novel and published\nBez dogmatu\n[\nWithout Dogma\n], which is considered by many critics his   main work. The novel is in the form of a journal, but unlike so   many other journals, it is never tiresome. With an art hardly   surpassed elsewhere it presents to us the type of a wordly man, a   religious and moral sceptic, who becomes unproductive because of   his morbid need for self-analysis. Through his perpetual   indecision, he prevents his own happiness, sacrifices that of   others, and finally succumbs. Ploszowski is a highly gifted man,   but he lacks moral bones, so to speak: he is without dogma. He is   hyper-aesthetic and extremely sophisticated, but the   sophistication cannot replace his lack of faith and spontaneity.   There is the figure of Anielka, delightful in her sad melancholy,   who watches the best hopes of her life pass away through the   egotism of Ploszowski, yet until the end remains faithful to the   laws of duty. The author shows us with insight how in a soul that   has once been Christian, like that of Ploszowski, the cult of   beauty is insufficient to fill the void left by the loss of   religious sentiment. Sienkiewicz has portrayed a type which   exists in all countries, a brilliant figure marred by   intellectual neurasthenia.\nBez dogmatu\nis a profoundly   serious book that invites reflection, but at the same time it is   an exquisite work of art, delicately chiselled. The inspired   account vibrates with controlled melancholy, and if the book   appears at times cold, it is the cold of a work of sculpture   inherent in many beautiful and noble works of art. We find this   frequently, for instance, in the works of Goethe.\nBez dogmatu\nwas followed in 1894 by\nRodzina   Polanieckich\n[\nChildren of the Soil\n], a work less   inspired than\nBez dogmatu\nbut characterized by great depth   in its description of the contrast of a useful country life and   hollow cosmopolitanism. Here again we find the figure of a superb   woman, the candid, devoted, and tender Marynia. Critics have   raised objections to a detail; that is, the sin of passion which   Polanieckich commits. Far from defending him, the author has   illustrated how a man whose life is neither abnormal nor   excessive, let alone perverted, is nonetheless capable of   committing a fault, but soon comes to his senses and repents it   without soft complacency. The ties between Polanieckich and his   wife are re-established even more firmly at the end of the book,   and the novel is really a glorification of domestic virtues and   of sane and salutary social activity. There is much charm in the   delicately drawn portrait of the sick child Litka, who sacrifices   her child’s love for Polanieckich in order to reconcile him with   Marynia. The episode is sublime and rich in purity and moving   poetry.\nThe same critics who blamed his trilogy for being too long have   cavilled at the rapid pace of the short tale\nPojdzmy za   nim\n(1892) [\nLet Us Follow Him\n], a simple sketch that   paints with great poetic beauty how the countess Antea, ill and   suffering from painful and dangerous hallucinations, is cured by   the dying and resurrected Saviour. In each case the criticism is   irrelevant, for the different subjects demand a different   treatment.\nPojdzmy za nim\nis admittedly a sketch, but it   is a story of deep and moving sensibility. Thus a master’s casual   chalk sketch because of its intimate characters is often almost   equal in value to his more elaborate works.\nPojdzmy za nim\nis written with noble piety; it is a modest flower growing at the   foot of the cross and enclosing in its blossom a drop of the   blood of the Saviour.\nReligious subjects soon led Sienkiewicz to a vast work that has   become universally famous. In 1895-96 he wrote\nQuo Vadis\n.   This history of the persecutions under Nero had an extraordinary   success. The English translation sold 800,000 copies in England   and America in one year. Professor Brückner, the historian   of Polish literature in Berlin, estimated in 1901 that about two   million copies had been sold in these two countries alone.\nQuo Vadis\nhas been translated into more than thirty   languages. Although one should not overestimate the importance of   such a success – bad books also spread easily provided they are   seductive – it still points clearly to the value of a work that   never addresses itself to the lower instincts of man but treats   an elevated subject in an elevated manner.\nQuo Vadis\nexcellently describes the contrast between the sophisticated but   gangrened paganism with its pride, and humble and confident   Christianity, between egotism and love, between the insolent   luxury of the imperial palace and the silent concentration of the   catacombs. The descriptions of the fire at Rome and the bloody   scenes in the amphitheatre are without equal. Henryk Sienkiewicz   discreetly avoids making Nero a major character, but in a few   strokes he has portrayed to us the dilettante crowned with all   his vanity and the folly of his grandeur, all his false   exaltation, all his cult of superficial art void of moral sense,   and all his capricious cruelty. The portrait of Petronius, drawn   in greater detail, is even better. The author was able to rely on   the inspired sketch in the two short chapters of the sixteenth   book of Tacitus’\nAnnals\n. Starting from these very brief   hints Sienkiewicz has constructed a psychological picture that   gives a strong appearance of truthfulness and is extremely   penetrating. Petronius, the man of sophisticated culture,\narbiter elegantiae\n, is a bundle of contradictions.   Epicurean and above all sceptic, he considers life a deceptive   mirage. Pleasures have made him effeminate, but he still has the   courage of a man. While free of prejudices, he is at times   superstitious. His sense of good and evil is not strongly   developed, but his sense of the beautiful is all the more marked.   He is a man of the world and in delicate situations he is capable   of acquitting himself with skill and sang-froid without   compromising his dignity. The sceptic Pyrrhon and the poet of   pleasure Anacreon please him more than the uncouth moralists of   the Stoa. He despises the Christians, whom he knows little. It   seems to him pointless and unworthy of a man to render good for   bad according to Christian doctrine. To hope for a life after   death, as the Christians do, seems to him as strange as if one   were to announce that a new day begins at night. Ruined by the   favourite Tigellinus, Petronius dies with the serenity of a death   that he had sought himself. The entire description is perfect in   its genre. But\nQuo Vadis\ncontains many other admirable   things. Especially beautiful is the episode, lit by the setting   sun, in which the apostle Paul goes to his martyrdom repeating to   himself the words that he had once written: «I have fought a   good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the   faith» (2 Tim., 4: 7).\nAfter this major work Henryk Sienkiewicz returned to the national   Polish novel and in 1901 wrote\nKrzyzacy\n[\nThe Knights of   the Cross\n]. The task was this time less easy than in the case   of the trilogy because there were fewer sources. But Sienkiewicz   overcame the difficulties and gave to his version a strong   medieval colour. The subject of the novel is the fight of the   Polish and Lithuanian nations against the Teutonic Knights who,   having long ago finished their original mission, had become an   oppressive institution more occupied with power and terrestrial   gains than with the cross whose insignia the members of the order   bore on their coats. It was the Archduke Jagiello, later King of   Poland under the name of Wladislaw II, who broke the dominance of   the order. He plays a role in the novel, although he is only   sketchily drawn according to Sienkiewicz’ custom of not giving   too much prominence to historical characters. The many characters   which are entirely the product of the author’s rich fancy attract   our attention more strongly and furnish excellent examples of   medieval civilization. It was a superstitious epoch and, although   the country had been Christianized for a long time, people still   put food out at night for vampires and revenants. Each saint had   his articular function. Apollonia was invoked for toothaches,   Liberius for stones. It is true that God the Father rules the   universe, but this very fact proves that he has no time to look   after human affairs of minor importance; consequently he has   delegated certain functions to saints. That epoch was indeed   superstitious, but it was also full of energy. Huge and solid,   the castle of the order stands at Marienburg. The Polish and   Lithuanian opponents of the monastic knights do not lack force,   either. There is Macko, crude, greedy, bent on the interests of   his family, but brave. There is the noble Zbyszko, his mind full   of chivalrous adventures. Surpassing all the others, colossal, as   if cut in granite, there is the redoubtable Jurand, cruel in his   hatred of the Teutonic Order and finally the victim of its   terrible revenge. In the hour of his humiliation he is more   sublime than ever because of his self-victory and the power of   his forgiveness. He is one of the most grandiose of Sienkiewicz’   warrior characters. Tableaux of gentleness alternate with those   of force. Queen Jadwiga is gentle, but her appearance is elusive.   The description of the funeral for the poor, sorely tested   Danusia is delicately beautiful like a softly chanted passion   service. On the other hand, the fresh and springlike picture of   Jagienka is radiant with exuberant health and liveliness. All   these creations have their individual life. Among the outstanding   minor characters are the irascible and bellicose Abbé,   unable to brook any contradiction, and Sanders, the seller of   indulgences, who sells a hoof of the donkey on which the flight   to Egypt took place, a piece of the ladder of Jacob, the tears of   the Egyptian Mary, and a little rust from the keys of St. Peter.   The closing episode, the battle of Tannenberg in 1410 in which   the squadrons of the Teutonic Order were crushed after a heroic   battle, is like the finale of a splendid musical drama.\nHenryk Sienkiewicz is certainly the first to recognize his debt   to old Polish literature. That literature is indeed rich. Adam   Mickiewicz is its true Adam, its ancestor by virtue of the full   nature of the poetry that distinguishes his great epic. Brilliant   as the stars in the sky of Polish literature are the names of   Slowacki, a man of fertile imagination, and of the philosopher   Krasinski. The epic art has been successfully practised by men   like Korzeniowski, Kraszewski, and Rzewuski. But with Henryk   Sienkiewicz that art has reached its full bloom and presents   itself in its highest degree of objectivity.\nIf one surveys Sienkiewicz’ achievement it appears gigantic and   vast, and at every point noble and controlled. As for his epic   style, it is of absolute artistic perfection. That epic style   with its powerful over-all effect and the relative independence   of episodes is distinguished by naive and striking metaphors. In   this respect, as Geijer has remarked, Homer is the master because   he perceives grandeur in simplicity as, for example, when he   compares the warriors to flies that swarm around a pail of milk,   or when Patroklos, who all in tears asks Achilles to let him   fight against the enemies, is compared to a little girl who   weeping clings to the dress of her mother and wants to be taken   in her arms. A Swedish critic has noticed in Sienkiewicz some   similes that have the clarity of Homeric images. Thus the retreat   of an army is compared to a retreating wave that leaves mussels   and shells on the beach, or the beginning of gunfire is compared   to the barking of a village dog who is soon joined in chorus by   all the other dogs. The examples could be multiplied. The attack   on the front and rear of an army surrounded and subject to fire   from both sides is compared to a field that is reaped by two   groups of mowers who begin their work at opposite sides of the   field with the purpose of meeting in the middle. In\nKrzyzacy\nthe Samogites rising from furrows attack the   German knights like a swarm of wasps whose nest has been damaged   by a careless wanderer. In\nPan Wolodyjowski\nwe also find   admirable images; in order to judge them we should remember that,   as often in Homer, the two terms of the comparison converge only   in one point, while the rest remains vague. Wolodyjowski with his   unique sword kills human lives around him as rapidly as a choir   boy after the mass snuffs the candles on the altar one after the   other with his long extinguisher. Hussein Pasha, the commander of   the Turkish army who vainly tries to leave by the gate that leads   to Jassy, returns to the camp to try another exit, just as a   poacher who has been tracked in a park tries to escape now on one   side and now on the other. The Christian martyrs of\nQuo   Vadis\nwho are prepared for death are already as removed from   earthly places as mariners who have pushed off and left the quay.   Many more situations equally Homeric and yet equally natural and   spontaneous could be cited; thus in\nKrzyzacy\nJagienka at   the unexpected sight of Zbyszko, who resembles a young prince,   stops short at the gate and nearly drops the jug of wine.\nThe literary production of Henryk Sienkiewicz is far from over.   At the moment he is in the process of publishing a new trilogy   entitled\nNa polu chwaly\n(1906) [\nOn the Field of   Glory\n] that deals with the time of Sobieski.\nHis own poetic career has indeed unfolded on the field of glory.   He has received valuable tokens of the devotion of his people,   all the more precious since, despite his ardent patriotism, he   has never flattered his country. On the occasion of his   twenty-fifth anniversary as an author a grand national   subscription provided the means to buy the castle that had been   the original seat of his family and to offer it to him as a   present. He was saluted by delegations, congratulatory messages   were sent, and the Warsaw theatre staged a gala performance in   his honour.\nAn homage from the North has now been added to these proofs of   admiration, for the Swedish Academy has decided to award the   Nobel Prize in Literature of 1905 to Henryk Sienkiewicz.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The Northerner does not stop until he has arrived   in the eternal city of Rome, just as the war for Italian unity   could not stop before Rome was conquered. But before arriving in   Rome the visitor is fascinated by the beauty of so many other   places. Among these, in the Appenines, is the Etruscan city of   Bologna, which is known to us through the\nSongs of Enzo\nby   Carl August Nicander.\nSince the Middle Ages, when a famous university gave it the title   of learned, Bologna has been of great importance in the cultural   history of Italy. Although in ancient times it was renowned as an   authority on jurisprudence, it has now become especially famous   for its poetic marvels. Thus, it is today still worthy of the   expression «Bononia docet» (Bologna teaches). For its   greatest poetic attainments of the present, it is indebted to the   man to whom the Nobel Prize has been awarded this year –   Giosuè Carducci.\nCarducci was born on July 27, 1835, in Val di Castello. He   himself has given an interesting account of his impressions from   his childhood and youth, and he has been the subject of several   good biographies.\nIn order to judge properly the development of his mind and his   talents, it is important to know that his father, Dr. Michele   Carducci, was a member of the Carboneria (a secret political   society working for Italian unity) and was active in the   political movements for Italian liberty, and that his mother was   an intelligent and liberal woman.\nMichele obtained a position as a doctor in Castagneto. The young   poet thus spent his earliest years in the Tuscan Maremma. He   learned Latin from his father, and Latin literature was to become   very familiar to him. Although Carducci later opposed Manzoni’s   ideas with great fervour, he was also strongly influenced for a   long time by his father’s admiration for the poet. At this time   he also studied the\nIliad\nand the\nAeneid\n, Tasso’s\nGerusalemme\n, Rollin’s Roman history, and Thier’s work on   the French Revolution.\nIt was a time of great political tension, and one can well   believe that in those days of discord and oppression the young   poet’s fiery imagination absorbed everything which had to do with   ancient liberty and the impending unification.\nThe boy soon turned into a little revolutionary. As he himself   recounts, in his games with his brothers and friends he organized   little republics which were governed by archons or consuls or   tribunes. Vigorous brawls frequently broke out. Revolution was   considered a normal state of affairs; civil war was always the   order of the day. The young Carducci stoned a make-believe Caesar   who was about to cross the Rubicon. Caesar had to flee and the   republic was saved. But the next day the little patriotic hero   got a sound trouncing from the conquering Caesar.\nNot too much stress need be laid on these games, since they are   frequent among young boys. But Carducci did, in fact, embrace   strong republican sympathies in later life.\nIn 1849 the family moved to Florence, where Carducci was enrolled                in a new school. Here, in addition to his required studies, he first                read the poetry of Leopardi, Schiller, and Byron. And soon he started                writing poetry – satiric sonnets. He later studied at the Scuola                Normale Superiore in Pisa, where he seems to have shown a great                deal of energy in his work. After finishing his studies he became                a teacher of rhetoric in San Miniato. Because of his expressions                of radical ideas, the grand-ducal government annulled his later                election to a post at the Arezzo elementary school. Afterward, however,                he taught Greek at the lyceum in Pistoia. Finally he obtained a                chair at the University of Bologna, where he has had a long and                highly successful career.\nThese in brief are the general lines of his external life. There   has been no lack of struggle in his career. He was, for example,   even suspended for some time from teaching in Bologna, and on   several occasions he was involved in lively polemics with several   Italian authors. He suffered great personal tragedies, of which   his brother Dante’s suicide was undoubtedly the most painful. But   his family life and his love for his wife and children have   offered him great consolation.\nThe fight for Italian liberty was extremely important to the   development of his sensibility. Carducci was a passionate   patriot; he followed the war with all the fire of his soul. And   no matter how much he may have been embittered by the defeats at   Aspromonte and Mentana, and no matter how much he was   disillusioned by the new parliamentary government, which was not   being organized in accordance with his desires, he was,   nevertheless, overjoyed at the triumph of his sacred patriotic   cause.\nHis ardent nature was tormented by anything which in his opinion   interfered with the fulfilment of the work for Italian unity. He   was not one to wait patiently; he continuously demanded immediate   results and felt a strong aversion to diplomatic delays and the   diplomatic\nfestina lente\n.\nIn the meantime his poetry blossomed abundantly. Although he is   also the author of excellent historical and literary criticism,   we should be concerned above all with his poetry, for it is   through his poetry that he has won his greatest fame.\nThe volume\nJuvenilia\n(1863) contains, as the title   indicates, his youthful work of the 1850’s. Two qualities   characterize this collection: on the one and, its classical cast   and intonation, sometimes carried to the point where Carducci   salutes Phoebus Apollo and Diana Trivia; and on the other, its   profoundly patriotic tone, accompanied by a violent hatred of the   Catholic Church and of the Pope’s power, the strongest obstacles   to Italian unity.\nIn strong opposition to ultramontanism, Carducci in his songs   evokes the memories of ancient Rome, the images of the great   French Revolution, and the figures of Garibaldi and Mazzini. At   times, when be believes Italy’s state hopeless and fears that all   of its ancient virtues and valiant deeds have been vitiated, he   plunges into the profoundest despair.\nThis bitterness helps to explain Carducci’s numerous attacks on   various authors and on other people; Carducci was generally   violent in his polemics. But in\nJuvenilia\nthere are also   poems with a more positive content, like the song to Victor   Emanuel, written in 1859 at the moment when it became obvious   that a war with Austria would soon break out. In this song he   jubilantly celebrates the monarch who bore the banner of Italian   unity.\nTrue patriotism is expressed in the sonnet «Magenta»   and in the poem «II Plebiscito», in which he renews his   enthusiastic praise of Victor Emanuel. . . The most beautiful of   the poems in\nJuvenilia\nis probably the poem to the Savoy   cross…\nThe later collection called\nLevia Gravia\n( 1868) [\nLight   and Heavy\n] contains the poems of the sixties. A certain   sadness can be heard in many of these poems. The long delay of   the conquest of Rome contributed much to Carducci’s bitter   feelings, but there were a great many other things which Carducci   passionately regretted in the prevailing politics of the day.   Carducci had expected more from the new political conditions than   they could offer. Yet we encounter some very beautiful poems in   this collection. Carducci was familiar with fourteenth-century   poetry, and a great many echoes of this epoch are heard, for   instance, in «Poeti di Parte Bianca» [«Poets of   the White Party»] and in his poem on the proclamation of the   Italian kingdom.\nOnly in the\nRime nuove\n(1877) [New Rhymes] and in the   three collections of the\nOdi barbare\n(1877-89) [\nThe   Barbarian Odes\n] do Carducci’s full lyrical maturity and   accomplished stylistic beauty appear. Here we no longer find the   same disdainful poet who fought with sword and fire under the   pseudonym of Enotrio Romano. Instead, the character of the poet   seems wholly transformed; sweeter, softer melodies are to be   heard. The introductory poem «Alla Rima» [«To   Rhyme»] is extremely musical, a true hymn to the beauty of   rhyme. Its ending excellently characterizes Carducci himself…   Evidently Carducci understood his own temperament, which he   compares with the Tyrrhenian Sea. But his uneasiness is not   continuous, and notes of real joy resound in the enchanting poem   «Idillio di Maggio» [«A May Eclogue»].   «Mattinata» [«Morning»], which clearly   recalls Hugo, is also lovely, as are the songs entitled   «Primavere Elleniche» [«Hellenic   Springtimes»] …\n«Ca Ira» [«The Rebellion»], a section of the\nRime nuove\n, is composed of a series of sonnets. Although   it is not of great poetic value, it does represent Carducci’s   more or less unreserved apotheosis of the French   Revolution.\nThe poet’s greatness is more fully revealed in his\nOdi   barbare\n, the first collection of which came out in 1877, the   second in 1882, and the third in 1889. There is some   justification, however, for criticism of the work’s form.\nAlthough Carducci adopted ancient meters, he transformed them so   entirely that an ear accustomed to ancient poetry will not hear   the classical rhythms. Many of these poems attain the pinnacle of   perfection in their poetic content. Carducci’s genius has never   reached greater heights than in some of his\nOdi barbare\n.   One need only name the fascinating «Miramar» and the   melodious and melancholy poem «Alla Stazione in una   Mattinata d’Autunno» [«To the Station On an Autumn   Morning»], products of the most noble inspiration. The song   «Miramar» is about the unfortunate emperor Maximilian   and his brief Mexican adventure. It excels as much in its moving   tragic tone as it does in its vivid nature imagery. The Adriatic   shore is depicted with perfect mastery. This song exhales a   certain feeling of compassion which is rare in Carducci’s   treatment of Austrian subject matter, but which he expressed yet   another time in the beautiful song on the Empress Elizabeth’s sad   fate in\nRime e Ritmi\n(1898) [Rhymes and Rythms]…\nMany contrasts clearly are to be found in a violent and rich   poetic nature like Carducci’s. Disapproval from many sides has   thus been mixed with the just admiration for this poet. Yet   Carducci is without doubt one of the most powerful geniuses of   world literature, and such disapproval, voiced also by his   compatriots, has not been spared even the greatest poets. No one   is without defect.\nThe blame is not, however, directed at his sometimes passionate   republican tendencies. Let his opinions remain his own   possession. No one will contest his independent political   position. In any case, his hostility toward the monarchy has   subsided with the years. He has come more and more to consider   the Italian dynasty as the protector of Italian independence. In   fact, Carducci has even dedicated poems to the queen mother of   Italy, Margherita. A venerable woman revered by almost all   factions, her poetic soul has been celebrated by Carducci’s   grandiose art. He has paid her beautiful and affectionate homage   in the magnificent song «alla Regina d’Italia»   [«To the Queen of Italy»] and in the immortal poem   «Il Liuto e la Lira» [«Lute and Lyre»], in   which, through the Provençal sirventes and the pastoral, he   expresses his admiration of the noble princess… The petty,   obstinate republicans, because of these and other tributes, have   looked upon Carducci as a deserter of their cause. He justly   responded, however, that a song of admiration dedicated to a   magnanimous and good woman has nothing whatever to do with   politics, and that he reserved the right to think and write   whatever he pleased about the reigning Italian family and its   members.\nThe reasons for the antagonism of his friends and political   partisans toward him are of a completely different origin. This   antagonism is occasioned less by his ferocious assaults on   persons of differing political opinions than by his   overenthusiastic paganism, which often assumes a biting tone   toward Christianity itself. His anti-Christian sentiments have   above all produced his much discussed hymn to Satan.\nThere is a good deal of justice in many of the attacks on   Carducci’s anti-Christianity. Although one cannot perfectly   approve of the way in which he has tried to defend himself in\nConfessioni e battaglie\n[Confessions and Battles] and in   other writings, a knowledge of the attendant circumstances helps   to explain, if not to justify, Carducci’s attitudes.\nCarducci’s paganism is understandable to a Protestant, at least.   As an ardent patriot who saw the Catholic Church as in many ways   a misguided and corrupt force opposed to the freedom of his   adored Italy, Carducci was quite likely to confuse Catholicism   with Christianity, extending to Christianity the severe judgments   with which he sometimes attacked the Church.\nStill we must not forget the genuine religious sentiments   expressed in some of his poems. It is helpful to remember the end   of «La Chiesa di Polenta» [«The Church of   Polenta«], which stands in healthy contrast to «In una   Chiesa Gotica» [«In a Gothic Church»].\nAnd as to the impetuous\nInno a Satana\n(1865) [\nHymn to   Satan\n], it would be a great wrong to Carducci to identify   him, for example, with Baudelaire and to accuse Carducci of   poisonous and unhealthy «Satanism» In fact, Carducci’s   Satan has an ill-chosen name. The poet clearly means to imply a   Lucifer in the literal sense of the word – the carrier of light,   the herald of free thought and culture, and the enemy of that   ascetic discipline which rejects or disparages natural rights.   Yet it seems strange to hear Savanarola praised in a poem in   which asceticism is condemned. The whole of the hymn abounds with   such contradictions. Carducci himself in recent times has   rejected the entire poem and has called it a «vulgar   sing-song». Thus, there is no reason to dwell any longer on   a poem which the poet himself has disavowed.\nCarducci is a learned literary historian who has been nurtured by   ancient literature and by Dante and Petrarch. But he cannot be   easily classified. He is not devoted to romanticism, but rather   to the classical ideal and Petrarchan humanism. Regardless of the   criticism which can justly be launched against him, the   irrefutable truth remains that a poet who is always moved by   patriotism and a love of liberty, who never sacrifices his   opinions to gain favour, and who never indulges in base   sensualism, is a soul inspired by the highest ideals.\nAnd insofar as his poetry in the aesthetic sense attains a rare   force, Carducci can be considered worthy in the highest degree of   the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nThe Swedish Academy thus pays respect to a poet who already   enjoys a world-wide reputation, and adds its homage of admiration   to the many praises already given him by his country. Italy has   elected Carducci senator and repaid the honour he has brought her   by assigning him a life-long pension amounting to a considerable   sum.\nAt the banquet, C.D. af Wirsén spoke   in Italian about the poet whom illness had prevented from coming   to Stockholm. Subsequently he addressed himself to the Italian   chargé d’affaires, Count Caprara, and recalled that through   the Nobel Prize Sweden had wanted to honour his country and one   of her greatest sons at the same time. Mr. Caprara expressed his   gratitude in French and, after a speech addressed to the country   of Alfred Nobel, promised to convey the homage to the poet.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

For centuries   past the literature of England has flourished and blossomed with   marvellous luxuriance. When Tennyson’s immortal lyre was silenced   forever, the cry which is so customary at the passing of literary   giants was raised. With him the glorious reign of poetry is over;   there is none to take up the mantle. Similar despairing notes   were struck in this country on the demise of Tegnér, but it   is not so with the fair goddess Poetry. She does not perish, is   not deposed from her high estate; she but arrays herself in a   fresh garb to suit the altered tastes of a new age.\nIn the works of Tennyson idealism is so pervasive that it meets   the eye in a very palpable and direct form. Traits of idealism,   however, may be traced in the conceptions and gifts of writers   who differ widely from him, such writers who seem primarily   concerned with mere externals and who have won renown especially   for their vivid word-picturings of the various phases of the   strenuous, pulsating life of our own times, that life which is   often chequered and fretted by the painful struggle for existence   and by all its concomitant worries and embarrassments. This   description applies to Rudyard Kipling, to whom the Swedish   Academy has awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature this year. Of   him a French author, who has devoted much time and study to   English literature, wrote more than six years ago: «He,   Kipling, is undoubtedly the most noteworthy figure that has   appeared within recent years in the domain of English   literature.»\nKipling was born in Bombay on December 30, 1865. At the age of   six he was placed in the care of some relatives in England, but   he returned to India on reaching the age of seventeen. He   obtained a position on the staff of\nThe Civil and Military   Gazette\n, published at Lahore, and in his early twenties   edited\nThe Pioneer\nat Allahabad. In his capacity as a   journalist, and for his own purposes, he travelled extensively   throughout India. On those journeys he acquired a thorough   insight into Hindu conceptions and sentiments and became   intimately acquainted with the different Hindu groups, with their   varying customs and institutions, and with the special features   of English military life in India. This firm grasp of the true   inwardness of all things Indian is abundantly reflected in   Kipling’s writings, so much so that it has even been said that   they have brought India nearer home to the English nation than   has the construction of the Suez Canal. Of his early works the   satirical\nDepartmental Ditties\n(1886) attracted notice by   the audacity of the allusions it contained, and by the   originality of its tone. Also among the early productions are\nPlain Tales from the Hills\n(1888) and\nSoldiers   Three\n(1888), collections of stories famous among other   things for the three lovingly drawn soldier types: Mulvaney,   Ortheris, and Learoyd. Other works in the same category are, for   instance,\nThe Story of the Gadsbys\n(1888), In\nBlack and   White\n(1888), and\nUnder the Deodars\n(1889), all of   which are concerned with society life in Simla. The series   entitled Life’s Handicap, embracing some stories of serious   import, appeared in 1891. The same year saw the publication of\nThe Light that Failed\n, a novel somewhat harsh in style but   containing some strongly coloured descriptive passages of   excellent effect.\nAs a poet Kipling was already full-fledged at the appearance of\nBarrack Room Ballads\n(1892), magnificent soldier-songs   brimming over with virile humour and depicting realistically   Tommy Atkins in all his phases, valiantly marching onward to   encounter dangers and misery wherever it pleases «the Widow   of Windsor», or her successor on the throne, to dispatch   him. In Kipling the British Army has found a minstrel to   interpret in a new, original, and tragicomical manner the toils   and deprivations through which it has to pass, and to depict its   life and work with abundant acknowledgment of the great qualities   it displays, but without the least trace of meretricious   embellishment. In his verses descriptive of soldiers and sailors   he so happily expresses their own thoughts, often in the very   language they themselves employ, that they appreciate him deeply   and, as we are told, sing his song whenever they have a pause in   the day’s occupations. Surely, there is hardly any greater mark   of honour that can be given to a poet than to be beloved by the   lower orders.\nIn the cycle entitled\nThe Seven Seas\n(1896) Kipling   reveals himself as an imperialist, a citizen of a world-wide   empire. He has undoubtedly done more than any other writer of   pure literature to draw tighter the bonds of union between   England and her colonies.\nIn Sweden, as elsewhere, «the jungle books» by Kipling,   the first of which appeared in 1894, are much admired and   beloved. A primordial type of imaginative power inspired the   creator of these mythlike tales of the animals in whose midst   Mowgli waxed in strength: Bagheera the Black Panther, Baloo the   Bear, Kaa the cunning and mighty Rock-Python, Nag the White   Cobra, and the chattering, foolish Monkeys. Some of the scenes   are simply sublime; for instance, the one where Mowgli is resting   in «the living armchair» Kaa, while the latter, who has   witnessed so many generations of trees and animals, dreams of   bygone ages; or again when Mowgli causes Hathi the Elephant to   «let in the jungle» to take over the fields of men.   These descriptions display an instinctive feeling for a poetry of   nature which is quite phenomenal, and Kipling is far more in his   true element in the primeval grandeur of these jungle stories   than, for instance, in «The Ship that Found Herself»   (in\nThe Day’s Work\n, 1898), an interesting though eccentric   personification of mechanical inventions.\nThe Jungle Book\ntales have made Kipling a favourite author among children in many   countries. Adults share the delight experienced by the young and   relive their childhood while perusing these marvellously   delightful, wonderfully imaginative fables of animals.\nAmong the large number of Kipling’s creations,\nKim\n(1901)   deserves special notice, for in the delineation of the Buddhist   priest, who goes on a pilgrimage along the banks of the stream   that purifies from sin, there is an elevated diction as well as a   tenderness and charm which are otherwise unusual traits in this   dashing writer’s style. There is, too, in the figure of the   little rascal Kim, the priest’s chela, a thorough type of   good-humoured roguishness.\nThe accusation has occasionally been made against Kipling that   his language is at times somewhat coarse and that his use of   soldier’s slang in some of the broadest of his songs and ballads   verges on the vulgar. Though there may be some truth in such   remarks, their importance is offset by the invigorating   directness and ethical stimulus of Kipling’s style. He has won   immense popularity, not only in the Anglo-Indian world, which   possesses in him a great literary master, but also far beyond the   limits of the vast British Empire. During his serious illness in   America in 1899, the American newspapers issued daily bulletins   regarding his condition, and the German Emperor dispatched a   telegram to his wife to express his earnest sympathy.\nWhat is then the cause of this world-wide popularity that Kipling   enjoys? Or, rather: In what way has Kipling shown himself to   deserve it? How is it, too, that he has been deemed worthy of the   Nobel Prize in Literature, for which a writer must especially   show an idealism in his conceptions and in his art? The answer   follows:\nKipling may not be eminent essentially for the profundity of his   thought or for the surpassing wisdom of his meditations. Yet even   the most cursory observer sees immediately his absolutely unique   power of observation, capable of reproducing with astounding   accuracy the minutest detail from real life. However, the gift of   observation alone, be it ever so closely true to nature, would   not suffice as a qualification in this instance. There is   something else by which his poetical gifts are revealed. His   marvellous power of imagination enables him to give us not only   copies from nature but also visions out of his own inner   consciousness. His landscapes appear to the inner vision as   sudden apparitions do to the eye. In sketching a personality he   makes clear, almost in his first words, the peculiar traits of   that person’s character and temper. Creativeness which does not   rest content with merely photographing the temporary phases of   things but desires to penetrate to their inmost kernel and soul,   is the basis of his literary activity, as Kipling himself says:   «He draws the thing as he sees it for the God of things as   they are.» In these weighty words lies a real appreciation   of the poet’s responsibility in the exercise of his   calling.\nRudyard Kipling’s manly, at times brusque, energy does not   preclude tenderness and delicacy of touch, though these qualities   never clamour affectedly for recognition in his works. The simple   «Story of Muhammad Din» is imbued with the poetry of   genuine heartfelt emotion, and who can ever forget the little   drummer boys in «The Taking of Lungtumpen» (in\nPlain   Tales\n)?\nIn the innermost being of this indefatigable observer of life and   human nature vibrate strings attuned to a lofty note. His poem   «To the True Romance» reveals that yearning for a   patiently sought, never to be attained ideal that resides in   living form in the breast of every true poet, from where the   scenes and impressions of the sensuous world can never dislodge   it:\nEnough for me in dreams to see\nAnd touch thy garment’s hem:\nThy feet have trod so near to God\nI may not follow them!\nThis writer’s philosophy of life is   diffused with a piety characteristic of the Old Testament, or   rather perhaps of Puritan times, wholly devoid of pretentiousness   or wordiness, based upon a conviction that «the fear of the   Lord is the beginning of wisdom» and that there exists a\nGod of our fathers, known of old,\nBeneath whose awful Hand we hold\nDominion…\nIf Kipling is an idealist from an aesthetic   point of view by reason of poetical intuition, he is so, too,   from an ethical-religious standpoint by virtue of his sense of   duty, which has its inspiration in a faith firmly rooted in   conviction. He is acutely conscious of the truth that even the   mightiest states would perish unless they rested upon the sure   foundation in the citizens’ hearts of a loyal observance of the   law and a reasoned self-restraint. For Kipling, God is first and   foremost Almighty Providence, termed in\nLife’s Handicap\na   «Greet Overseer». The English as a nation can well   appreciate these conceptions, and Kipling has become the nation’s   poet, owing not only to his numerous highly prized soldier-songs,   but perhaps quite as much to the brief lines of the hymn   («Recessional») which he composed on the occasion of   Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in 1897. Especially striking are   these words expressing genuine and humble religious feelings:\nThe tumult and the shouting dies;\nThe Captains and the Kings depart:\nStill stands Thine ancient sacrifice,\nAn humble and a contrite heart.\nThe recessional hymn voices the spirit of   national pride, yet it also conveys a warning against the dangers   of presumptuous pride…\nQuite naturally, during the Boer War Kipling sided with his own   nation, the English. He has, however, done full justice to the   heroic courage of he Boers, for his imperialism is not of the   uncompromising type that pays no regard to the sentiments of   others.\nMany and varied are the movements that have had their vogue in   English literature, a literature unparalleled for wealth of   output and adorned to surpass all others by the immortal figure   of Shakespeare. In Kipling may be traced perhaps more of Swift   and Defoe than of Spenser, Keats, Shelley, or Tennyson. Clearly,   however, imagination is as strong in him as empirical   observation. Though he does not possess the refined and   sensuously beautiful style of Swinburne, yet he escapes, on the   other hand, all tendency toward a pagan worship of pleasure for   pleasure’s sake. He avoids all morbid sentimentality in matter   and Alexandrian superflorescence in form.\nKipling favours concreteness and concentration; empty   abstractions and circumlocutionary descriptions are wholly absent   from his works. He has a knack for finding the telling phrase,   the characteristic epithet, with swift accuracy and certainty. He   has been compared now to Bret Harte, now to Pierre Loti, now to   Dickens; he is, however, always original, and it would seem that   his powers of invention are inexhaustible. Nevertheless, the   apostle of the imagination is likewise, as stated above, the   standard-bearer of law-abidingness and discipline. The Laws of   the Jungle are the Laws of the Universe; if we ask what their   chief purport is, we shall receive the brief answer:   «Struggle, Duty, Obedience». Kipling thus advocates   courage, self-sacrifice, and loyalty; unmanliness and lack of   self-discipline are abominations to him, and in the world order   he perceives a nemesis before which presumption is constrained to   surrender.\nIf Kipling is quite independent as a writer, it does not follow   that he has learned nothing from others; even the greatest   masters have done so. With Bret Harte, Kipling shares his   appreciation of the picturesqueness of vagabond life, and with   Defoe his accuracy in depicting every detail and his sense of the   values of exactness in the use of terms and phrases. Like Dickens   he feels a keen sympathy with those of low degree in the   community, and like him he can perceive the humour in trifling   traits and acts. But his style is distinctively original and   personal. It accomplishes its ends by suggestion rather than by   description. It is not quite uniformly brilliant but it is always   eminently expressive and picturesque. The series\nFrom Sea to   Sea\n(1899) is a veritable model of graphic description,   whether the scene is laid in the Elephant City governed by the   Grand Divinity of Laziness, in Palm Island, or in Singapore, or   whether the story deals with manners and customs of Japan.   Kipling has at his command a large fund of irony – sometimes   highly pungent – but he has abundant resources of sympathy, too,   sympathy for the most part extended to those soldiers and sailors   who have upheld the honour of England in far-distant lands. He   has every right and reason to tell them: «I have eaten your   bread and your salt, I have drunk your water and wine, I have   lived your life, I have watched o’er your beds of   death.»\nHe attained fame and success as a very young man, but he has   continued to develop ever since. One of his biographers has   stated that there are three «notes» to be traced in his   authorship. The satirical note is found in\nDepartmental   Ditties\n,\nPlain Tales from the Hills\n,\nThe Story of   the Gadsbys\n, with its amusing commendation of single   blessedness, and in the much-debated novel,\nThe Light that   Failed\n. The second, the note of sympathy and human kindness,   is most clearly marked in «The Story of Muhammad Din»   and in «Without Benefit of Clergy» (in\nLife’s   Handicap\n), a gem of heartfelt emotion. The third, the ethical   note, is clearly traceable in\nLife’s Handicap\n. Whether   there be much value or not in this classification which, as is   usually the case in such matters, cannot be consistently applied   to the whole of his production, one thing is certain: Kipling has   written and sung of faithful labour, fulfilment of duty, and love   of one’s country. Love of one’s country with Kipling does not   mean solely devotion to the island kingdom of England, but rather   an enthusiastic affection for the British Empire. The closer   uniting of that Empire’s separate members is a long and fervently   cherished aspiration of the poet’s. That is surely clear from his   exclamation: «What should they know of England who only   England know?»\nKipling has given us descriptions in vivid colours of many   different countries. But the picturesque surface of things has   not been the principal matter with him; he has always, in all   places, had a manly ideal before him: ever to be «ready, ay   ready at the call of duty» and then, when the appointed time   comes, to «go to God like a soldier».\nThe Swedish Academy, in awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature   this year to Rudyard Kipling, desires to pay a tribute of homage   to the literature of England, so rich in manifold glories, and to   the greatest genius in the realm of narrative that that country   has produced in our times.\nThere was no banquet because of the death   of King Oscar II of Sweden on December 8, 1907.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Mankind still seemed to him to need help,   and therefore he thought that the best investment for his own   fortune would be to use ts interest to support those of whom the   future would reveal that – in the words of his will –   «mankind profited most from them».\nThe ambiguity of all human work and its tools or weapons   challenged him to a personal deed in behalf of human progress. He   knew the enormous usefulness f his own technical inventions for   military purposes; therefore, he wanted to support any promising   efforts toward international peace. How could his worldly mind   have overlooked that all our civilization is full of strife, that   it invites abuse as well as proper use, and that it can be turned   toward evil as well as good?\nHis chief interest, however, was the intellectual sphere, despite   its inherent contradictions. It appeared to him, the cosmopolitan   familiar with the languages and civilizations of France and   England, as a complex of arts and sciences, of exact natural   science and humanistic belles-lettres. The former he sought to   stimulate by supporting discoveries and inventions for the   benefit of mankind. Turning to literature with the same   philanthropic concern, he established a prize for what he called   «excellence in works of an idealistic tendency».\nAlfred Nobel was deeply influenced by the outlook of Victor   Rydberg’s poetry and philosophy. He knew what ideals mean to the   human mind, to the will that creates and maintains civilization,   cultivates and reaps its fruits, and through the struggle and   darkness of life breaks a path toward a new dawn of light and   peace. Wherever such ideals are manifested in their infinite   variety and strengthen the willingness of men to serve each other   – whether in the poet’s inspiration, the philosopher’s attempt to   solve the riddle of life, the historian’s biographies, or the   work of any scholar or writer that looks toward those ideals as   models in his freedom and independence – there one finds the   literature that Alfred Nobel had in mind. This literature makes   use of whatever art and science can offer, and from it mankind   «profits the most» precisely because it mirrors the   ideal truth without any regard for the useful. The creations and   forms of this literature are as manifold s the ideals, and they   are forever new and free.\nThe Swedish Academy has therefore felt that it acted with the   sanction of Alfred Nobel when it decided this year to award the   literary prize founded by Nobel to one of the most prominent   thinkers of our age, Professor Rudolf Eucken, «in   recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating   power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and   strength of presentation with which in his numerous works he has   vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of   life».\nFor over thirty years Professor Eucken has been publishing   profound contributions in several areas of philosophy. His   activity as a writer has yielded increasingly many and important   books as his basic philosophy has become both more coherent and   more comprehensive. Particularly in recent years he has published   the works that afford us the most thorough introduction to his   thought; moreover, the wider public has received from him   uncommonly lucid and powerful expositions of his attempts to   resolve the most urgent problems of contemporary civilization.   Thus he is in the midst of giving the final shape to his mature   thought, and everywhere one can see new ideas which we hope he   will be able to develop fully in the near future.\nI cannot here give a detailed account of Eucken’s long and   versatile career as a philosopher, because time is short and the   subject difficult for one with little knowledge of most of his   special fields. I can only make some generalizations and dwell in   particular on the historical foundations of his\nWeltanschanung\nand his views on the meaning of historical   processes. Professor Eucken considers history a decisive   influence on his philosophy, and it was philological and   historical studies that led him toward philosophy. Ever since his   early days the actual life of man and society has meant much more   to him than the abstractions of mere thought analysis.   Unfortunately we shall have to omit many interesting   ramifications of his thought in order to get a clear picture at   least of its main results.\nThe confident and rising idealism today in the intellectual life   not only of Germany but everywhere on the higher and freer levels   of civilized life is very different from those proud   constructions which bore that name and which went bankrupt half a   century ago with Hegel’s magnificent system. It was an attempt to   derive the inexhaustible wealth of life and the world from   abstract categories and concepts by means of a daring dialectic,   and to force all human research, all civilization, under the yoke   of a complete system of thought. But closer analysis revealed   this attempt to be beyond the competence of the philosophical   search for truth, and in fact it accelerated the change to an   equally dogmatic materialism.\nWe Swedes know that even at the zenith of dialectic absolutism   Boström directed his logical criticisms toward its basic   attitudes. By going back to earlier views both here and abroad,   he developed a different outlook which has had its adherents in   this country up to the present. There is an indisputable   resemblance between his views and those developed by Professor   Eucken in his writings. This is not surprising, for they both   represent a basic type that since the earliest days of   civilization – notwithstanding temporary eclipses – has preserved   its vitality in the face of pantheistic abstractions as well as   materialistic fear of thought. But this characteristic agreement   in their basic views does not exclude independent and personal   development; on the contrary it rather promotes it, and no branch   of philosophy has produced so many marked profiles as realistic   idealism. Socrates and Plato were led by this idealism to hold   that philosophy is a search for truth rather than a fixed dogma,   and this tireless search, by whatever means, has characterized   philosophy throughout the ages. Thus Eucken and Boström   reached their common goal by quite different means.\nSince his youth Eucken has carefully observed the busy and steady   philosophical attempts to reassess external and inner experience   and to gain firm ground again after the collapse of the bold   philosophical systems. Philosophy turned in different directions   with varying expectations and success. Sometimes the motto was   «Back to Kant», and the great metaphysical iconoclast   served as a model for thorough studies of the limits of human   knowledge, or else one listened hesitantly to his declaration of   an eternal realm of reason based on unassailable moral   postulates. Again there were attempts to give philosophy a safe   position by tying it to the victorious advances of modern science   or, more successfully, by independently questioning its   presuppositions and methods. There were attempts to discover the   secrets of the human soul in its manifestations, whether by   observation or experiment, and there was hope that such research   would lead toward the discovery of the proper relation of   physical and psychological existence.\nEucken has been familiar with all these schools, but his main   field has been historical and critical research on the emergence   and development of mainstreams of thought in connection with the   evolution and change of general culture. Like so many pioneers in   his field, he has always been convinced that there can be no true   progress without a proper regard for tradition and that there is   more to the annals of philosophy than a kaleidoscope of systems   rising and falling with equal suddenness. As Eucken has often   emphasized, there can be no continuity in philosophy unless it   grows like the other sciences and continually treats and develops   the same problems, lest every mind should believe that he could   start all over from the beginning only to be replaced by someone   else in the same manner.\nApart from collections of monographs and essays in this field,   Eucken as early as 1878 published the first comprehensive results   of his method. In\nGrundbegriffe der Gegenwart\n[Basic   Concepts of Modern Thought] he discusses the origin, formulation,   and development of common modern concepts since the days of   ancient philosophy and scholasticism. Such terms are   «subjective nd objective», «experience and   evolution», «monism and dualism»,   «mechanistic and organic», «law and   individuality», «personality and character»,   «theoretical and practical», «immanence and   transcendence». But he is not interested merely in   definition of terms; he wants to describe the leading goals and   attitudes of a period by elucidating, in his own words,   «concepts as a mirror of their time». With each   dissection the object becomes more clearly delineated. In the   fourth edition, which appeared this year, the scope of the book   has widened; it has become a thorough critique of the conflicts   in modern civilization; accordingly, the title of the book has   been changed to\nGeistige Strömungen der Gegenwart\n(1908) [\nMain Currents of Modern Thought\n]. Indeed, the   author has developed his own basic ideas in it, and it is a   rewarding labour to study them in their wealth and   complexity.\nA thinker who considers the perennial questions of human   civilization from this point of view will soon learn that he   cannot solve them either by ignoring their close interrelation or   by limiting himself to epistemological questions. Undoubtedly   these problems constantly impinge upon each other; they cover the   whole of human existence, influence individuals that are   particularly susceptible to their importance, and thereby   exercise a reforming power over entire communities and ages. The   attempt to trace them in their vital and seminal role amounts to   giving a comprehensive survey of human intellectual history. At   the same time such a project is more conducive to arousing and   widening philosophical interest than a mere analysis of   conflicting dogmas, schools, and sects. Eucken undertook such a   task in\nDie Lebensanschauungen der grosser Denker: Eine   Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebensproblems der Menschheit von   Plato his zur Gegenwart\n(1890) [\nThe Problem of Human Life   as Viewed by the Great Thinkers from Plato to the Present   Time\n]. This work, revised and expanded through seven   editions, bears witness not only to the depth and scope of   Eucken’s research but to his mastery of marshalling his thoughts   and to the maturity of his style.\nEucken has developed his own philosophy in several works such as\nDer Kampf um einen geistigen Lebensinhalt: Neue Grundlegung   einer Weltanschauung\n(1896) [The Struggle for a Spiritual   Content of Life: New Principles of a Philosophy] and\nGrundlinien einer neuen Lebensanschauung\n(1907) [\nLife’s   Basis and Life’s Ideal: The Fundamentals of a New Philosophy of   Life\n] as well as the more popular\nDer Sinn und Wert des   Lebens\n( I908)[\nThe Meaning and Value of Life\n] and\nEinführung in eine Philosophie des Geisteslebens\n(1908) [Introduction to a Philosophy of the Mind]. The last   mentioned work in particular is a masterly and lucid exposition   of his views.\nIn recent years Eucken has also turned his attention to religious   questions, in\nDer Wahrheitsgehalt der Religion\n(1901)   [\nThe Truth of Religion\n] and\nHauptprobleme der   Religionsphilosophie der Gegenwart\n(1907) [Main Problems of   Contemporary Philosophy of Religion], the latter based on three   lectures delivered during a theological summer institute at the   University of   Jena. This year he has developed his ideas about the   philosophy of history at some length in a treatise that forms   part of the great encyclopaedic work\nDie Kultur der   Gegenwart\n[Contemporary Civilization]. According to hints in   recent works he is now planning a thorough re-examination of   ethical problems.\nHis deep insights into history and his significant attempts to   relate his own thoughts on the forces of life to the evidence of   history place Eucken far above the superficial attitudes that   exaggerate and misinterpret the inner meaning of history. These   attitudes, at the cost of an unprejudiced love of truth, have   become all too common in this century of history.\nFurthermore, Eucken sees a threat to civilization in the   caricature of historicism, which partly intends to drag all firm   goals and higher aims into the whirlpool of a misunderstood   relativity and partly supports the frequent attempts to limit and   paralyze the human will by fitting all human developments and   achievements into a supposed naturalistic and fatalistic causal   nexus. But in contrast to Nietzsche, for instance, he does not   believe in the right or ability of the overweening individual to   maintain his own will to power in the face of the obligations to   the eternal majesty of moral laws. It is not the individual or   the superman in his separate existence, but the strong character   formed in the consciousness of free harmony with the intellectual   forces of the cosmos, and therefore profoundly independent, that   in Eucken’s view is called upon to liberate us from the   superficial compulsion of nature and the never completely   inescapable pressure of the historical chain of cause and   effect.\nIn history as well as in his personal existence man has life of a   higher nature, a life originating not in nature but existing in   itself and through itself, a life of the mind, which is in   reality beyond time but which is revealed to us only in temporal   manifestations. All true development presupposes some basis of   existence. To the extent to which man comes to participate in the   intellectual life, he acquires a power that is eternal and above   the vicissitudes of time. This eternal life is a realm of truth,   for truths with a limited existence are unthinkable. At the same   time it is an infinite whole of living power, far above the world   as it appears to us but exercising its influence in the world for   us and through us. It is not an abstract castle in the air to   which we can escape on the wings of a mystical and supposedly   logical imagination, but as a wholly living power it confronts   our entire personality with an either-or, a choice of the will   that makes the evolution of man and mankind a ceaseless struggle   between the higher and the lower life.\nHistory is the mirror of mankind’s victories and defeats in this   struggle, the vicissitudes of which have been due to the   self-determination of the free personality. Hence no philosophy   of history can predict the future of this struggle. Even the   civilization handed to us as a heritage does not survive by   itself but demands our persistent and personal struggle for the   true and genuine life of the mind. Nothing else can justify and   support our endeavours for morality and art and our political and   social work.\n«Utilitarianism,» Eucken says, «which ever form it   assumes, is irreconcilably opposed to true intellectual culture.   Any intellectual activity degenerates unless it is treated for   its own sake.» Although a great admirer and lover of art,   Eucken has turned with equal severity against the aestheticism   which is preached so loudly in our days and which «infects   only reflective and pleasure-loving hedonists». «No art   that values itself and its task can afford to condemn morality. A   creative artist of the highest order has hardly ever been a   follower of an aesthetic view of life.» Our Runeberg is a   poet after his heart, for such an outlook «with its   indifference to moral values and its arrogant exclusiveness is   quite foreign to him». And only those nations, whether great   or small, that have created and maintained a civilization full of   genuine intellectual life have a contribution to make to mankind.   A contribution may be made only by those nations whose future   consists not in a vain endeavour to use aterial force and weapons   to «transform quantity into quality», but in the ever   growing revelation of eternal life within the limits of temporal   existence.\nEucken does not reject a metaphysics that tries to express   conceptually those things that are accessible to us in the   infinite realm of truth and life. But he has not constructed an   everlasting system, nor did he want to do so. His philosophy,   which he himself calls a philosophy of action, operates primarily   with the forces of human evolution and is therefore more dynamic   than static. We may regard him as a\nKulturphilosoph\nwho   fully meets the standards and needs of our age.\nProfessor Eucken – The lofty and scholarly idealism of your\nWeltanschauung,\nwhich has found such vigorous expression   in your many and widely read works, has justified the Swedish   Academy in awarding to you the Nobel Prize in Literature for this   year.\nThe Academy greets you with sincere and respectful admiration and   hopes that your future works, too, will bear ample fruit for the   benefit of culture and humanity.\nAt the banquet, Harald Hjärne   addressed, in German, his personal congratulations to Professor   Eucken. He recalled Thuringia and, in particular, the University   of Jena, the heart of German humanism, and the relations of that   university with the history of the Swedish Reformation. In his   reply, Mr. Eucken spoke enthusiastically about the idealism for   which he had struggled and expressed his gratitude toward Sweden   and the Swedish Academy.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The time of arms has passed, but in the international competition   for peaceful prizes our people have for a long time held a   position of esteem, and now the hour has finally come when Sweden   can enter into literary competition with the great nations. The   realm of the mind is determined by living powers that are not   measured by population or golden millions but by the idealistic   and ethical demands which they satisfy.\nGeijer, Tegnér, or Runeberg, to mention only them, could   justly have laid claim to the Nobel Prize, and the development   which these great men have started has grown to fuller bloom. But   among the writers of the younger generation who have contributed   so much to our literature, there is one name that enjoys the   special splendour of a star of the first magnitude. In the works   of Selma Lagerlöf we seem to recognize the purest and best   features of our Great Swedish Mother. Five years ago the Swedish   Academy recognized the importance and strength of her achievement   for Swedish poetry by awarding her the Gold Medal «because   of the imaginative wealth, idealism, and narrative talent that   are evidenced in her works, which are beloved inside and outside   the borders of Sweden». This homage was strongly appreciated   by all classes in our nation. Surely the same nation will be   proud to hear today that the Swedish Academy has found Selma   Lagerlöf’s literary achievement so important that her works   should be counted among those considered the property of all   mankind and that they are full of the idealism which Nobel   required for the award of the Nobel Prize. It should not be   thought that this decision was inspired by excessive national   self-esteem, especially since many important foreign opinions   have supported her candidacy. Nor would anybody consider it a   lack of modesty if the Nobel Prize, which is now being awarded   for the ninth time, remains in the country of its founder; on the   contrary, such modesty could be interpreted as a lack of national   self-confidence.\nFew first novels have attracted so much attention as\nGösta Berlings Saga\n(1891). The work was significant   not only because it broke decisively with the unhealthy and false   realism of the times, but also because of its own original   character. Yet the work was not unanimously praised; if most   people admired it greatly, some criticized it severely. There   could be no better proof of its extraordinary character. One   could not help admiring an imagination that had not had its peer   since Almqvist’s days. However peculiar the characters and   situations created by this imagination might be, they were   covered by the marvellous bloom of artistic genius, and the   presentation at times exhibited rapturous beauty. The reader was   particularly moved by the profound feeling that in this work he   was encountering a forgotten piece of what had once been Swedish   country life; his heart was captured, just as the curious,   radiant surface of the picture enchanted his senses. This first   novel did have its weaknesses; how could it be otherwise! Where   is gold found pure; when does a genius enter the world completely   mature? But one thing was abundantly clear: a new genius of   genuine Swedish nature was trying its wings.\nSoon she was to enter the realm of her true heritage, the   mystical world of fairy tales and legends. Only a soul that had   fed on legends since the days of childhood, and that added love   to a rich imagination, could dare to interpret the secrets of the   invisible world that the visionary always sees beside or rather   beneath the visible world. The visionary quality that is so   characteristic in Lagerlöf’s writings has been stronger in   her than in anyone since the days of St. Birgitta. Just as   refractions in the hot air of the desert create a vivid fata   morgana for the wanderer, so her warm and colourful imagination   possesses a wonderful power of giving to her visions the force of   living reality, which is instinctively recalled by whoever   listens to her poetry. This is particularly true of her   description of nature. For her, everything, even what is called   inanimate nature, has its own, invisible, but real life; and   therefore her artist’s hand is not content with representing the   outward beauty of nature. Her loving eye follows the inner life   whose silent language has been caught by her fine ear. That is   why she has succeeded in eliciting beautiful secrets from fairy   tales, living folk legends, and saints’ stories; secrets that had   been hidden from the wordly-wise but which true simplicity   perceives because, as the poet has the old grandmother say, it   «has eyes to see the secrets of God».\nAs a painter of peasant life she is completely original and can   compete with the best of other countries.\nTösen från   Stormyrtorpet\n(1908) [\nThe Girl from the Marsh Croft\n]   is inimitable in its realistic and faithful descriptions, and it   contains a new and deeper beauty in the irresistible power of   unselfish love which underlies the whole work. And there are many   other pieces of equal beauty. But Selma Lagerlöf’s talent   comes out most clearly in the proud achievement that bears the   name\nJerusalem\n(1901-02) [\nThe Holy City\n]. The deep   spiritual movements that have from time to time aroused the   peasant population of our country have rarely been traced so   clearly as in this description of the pilgrimage of the people of   Dalekarlia to the Holy Land. The reader sees things as dearly as   if he himself were experiencing how this strong breed with its   serious and introspective character goes its way, brooding   heavily over the riddles of life. And it is not surprising if   these people, torn between belief and superstition, in the   painful struggle between their love of the inherited soil and   their fear that they may not walk with God, finally abandon home,   since they believe that the bells on high admonish them to march   toward the holy city. But it is no less natural if these children   of voluntary exile, in the midst of their delight at having seen   the earth that had been touched by the foot of the Saviour, are   deep in their hearts consumed by the desire for the simple green   soil far north in old Dalarna. The sound of rivers and forests is   always in their ears. With loving perception the poet has sounded   the secret depth of their souls and a bloom of purest poetry   transforms the realistic and faithful description of their   touching and simple lives. The introduction to\nJerusalem\n,   entitled «Ingemarssönerna» [Ingemar’s Sons],   movingly intimates that the lives and deeds of the fathers work   like a force of destiny on later generations.\nSelma Lagerlöf’s style deserves our full appreciation. Like   a loyal daughter, she has administered the rich heritage of her   mother tongue; from this source come the purity of diction, the   clarity of expression, and the musical beauty that are   characteristic of all her works.\nPurity and simplicity of diction, beauty of style, and power of   imagination, however, are accompanied by ethical strength and   deep religious feeling. And indeed it could not be otherwise in   someone to whom the life of man is a «thread on God’s great   loom». In poetry of such elevation the air is always pure;   more than one of her beautiful legends reflect the simplicity and   loftiness of Scripture. But what makes Selma Lagerlöf’s   writings so lovable is that we always seem to hear in them an   echo of the most peculiar, the strongest, and the best things   that have ever moved the soul of the Swedish people. Few have   comprehended the innermost nature of this people with a   comparable love. It is her own heart that speaks when in\nTösen från Stormyrtorpet\nthe strict judge, whose   severe features have increasingly brightened at the sight of the   sacrificial love of the young girl, finally says with deep   emotion to himself: «That is my people. I shall not be angry   with them since there is so much love and fear of God in one of   their humblest creatures.» Such an intimate and profound   view is possible only for one whose soul is deeply rooted in the   Swedish earth and who has sucked nourishment from its myths,   history, folklore, and nature. It is easy to understand why the   mystical, nostalgic, and miraculous dusk that is peculiar to the   Nordic nature is reflected in all her works. The greatness of her   art consists precisely in her ability to use her heart as well as   her genius to give to the original peculiar character and   attitudes of the people a shape in which we recognize   ourselves.\nWe are acting according to the will of the founder if we honour   those who have had such success in appealing to the best sides of   the human heart, and whose name and achievement have penetrated   far beyond the borders of Sweden. Nor should anyone who bears a   famous literary name, whether inside or outside the country, be   envious if the Swedish Academy today pronounces that it has   awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in Literature to Sweden’s   distinguished daughter, Selma Lagerlöf\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The Swedish Academy has awarded it to a writer whose nomination has been supported by more than sixty German experts on art, literature, and philosophy. His name is Paul Heyse. The name revives the memory of our youth and manhood; we still remember the literary pleasure that his novellas, in particular, gave to us. Now an old but still active man, he is a figure that the jury could not pass over if it was to express its admiration by awarding the high distinction to the most significant literary work. Nor was the jury to be swayed by considerations of age or, indeed, anything other than true merit.\nPaul Heyse was born in Berlin in 1830. His father was the philologist Karl Wilhelm Heyse, a gentle but determined scholar. From his Jewish mother, Julie Saaling, Heyse perhaps inherited his warm and lively temperament. Heyse, who was nature’s favourite in so many ways, had the good fortune of growing up in a carefree home. His school years passed quickly. He was an easy learner. For a while he was a student in Berlin and later he studied Romance philology under Friedrich Diez at Bonn University. In 1852 he received his doctorate in Berlin\nmulta cum laude\n. Subsequently Heyse was awarded a scholarship that enabled him to travel in Italy, with whose art and literature he was to become so familiar. He soon became engaged to Margarete Kugler, the daughter of the art historian to whose house he had been introduced by his patron, the poet Emanuel Geibel. Not sure where to look for a position, he was freed from all material worries by Geibel, who once more helped him. At Geibel’s recommendation Maximilian II offered him a titular professorship at Munich. His only duty consisted in taking part in the literary soirees of the King. On May 15, 1854, he was married to Margarete and the happy young couple settled in Munich, where Heyse has lived ever since, with the exception of occasional sojourns in his beloved Italy. Soon he became the central figure of a thriving cultural life. Since this is not the place for a detailed biography of Heyse, suffice it to say that several years after the death of Margarete he married again, this time the charming Anna Schubart.\nBetween 1855 and 1862 Heyse wrote the first four volumes of his prose novellas, a genre in which he became a master. Among Heyse’s many novellas we may mention here\nL’Arrabbiata\n(1853);\nAndrea Delfin\n(1859), rich in Venetian colours; the deeply felt\nNerina\n(1875), an episode from Leopardi’s life; the profoundly moral\nBild der Mutter\n(1859) [Portrait of a Mother]; and the marvellous troubadour novella\nMarion\n(1855). In his novellas Heyse observes strict rules of composition without doing violence to the charm and freedom of the story. He developed his own theory of the novella. «A novella of literary value», he wrote, «should represent an important human destiny. It must not be an everyday occurrence but should reveal to us a new side of human nature. The narrow scope of the tale calls for strict concentration.»\nIt has rightly been said that Heyse is the creator of the modern psychological novella. He is rarely tendentious in his novellas, and that is probably the reason we prefer their Goethean objectivity to his longer narratives\nKinder der Welt\n(1872) [\nThe Children of the World\n] and\nIm Paradiese\n(1875 ) [\nIn Paradise\n], which deal with moral problems, the former with the independence of morality from narrow dogmas, the latter with a defence of art against an austere puritanism. Both works unmistakably show the humanism of their creator. In\nIm Paradiese\nthere is in addition a vivid description of the artists’ world in Munich. In\nGegen den Strom\n(1904) [Against the Stream] Heyse courageously challenged engrained prejudices by turning against the practice of duelling. A curiously youthful power is evident in the book\nGeburt der Venus\n(1909) [Birth of Venus], which appeared last year and in which he consistently and emphatically develops his lifelong aesthetic convictions both by defending the freedom of art from a one-sided asceticism and by polemizing against the naturalistic technique of copying the low, the common, and the simple-minded.\nHeyse, however, is not only a writer of novels and novellas; he is the most important lyrical poet of contemporary Germany. He has written delightful novellas in verse, of which the admirable\nSalamander\n(1879) in terza rime is especially memorable. Although drama was not his natural medium, he has nonetheless written excellent plays, among them – to select two from a total of over fifty – the patriotic play\nKolberg\n(1865) and the interesting drama\nHadrian\n(1865), in which the wisdom and sadness of Hadrian are combined and represented in a most moving manner.\nHeyse’s taste is very independent. While he had great admiration for\nThe Pretenders and Vikings at Helgeland\nby his friend Ibsen, he liked neither\nGhosts\nnor the following symbolic plays. He is deeply musical, but not so much moved by Wagner as by Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Chopin, and Brahms.\nIn all critical situations of life Heyse has maintained the same independence. When his friend Geibel lost his salary as a poet at the Bavarian court because of a poem to King William in which he expressed his hope for a united Germany under Prussia, Heyse, too, in a respectful letter offered to resign his position, since he agreed with Geibel on every point and therefore wished to share his fate as well.\nHeyse is almost as popular in Italy as in Germany. His numerous brilliant translations have made Italian literature known in Germany. It is due to him that Leopardi, Manzoni, Foseolo, Monti, Parini, and Giusti are now widely read and admired there.\nBut it would be wrong to assume that the brilliant Heyse, so often called he laurel-crowned favourite of fortune, was always free from cares or was always acknowledged in the leading circles of his country. As a father he was deeply afflicted by the loss of several of his beloved children. He expressed his grief in deeply poetic songs which despite their gloom radiate an unending beauty…\nAs for literary opinion, it is true that the Apollonian and charming poet enjoyed early popularity, but it is equally true that there was a time when the situation changed. Naturalism, which burst forth in the eighties and dominated the scene for the next decade, directed its iconoclastic attack especially against Heyse, its most powerful opponent. He was too harmonious, too fond of beauty, too Hellenic and lofty for those who, slandering him at any price, demanded sensation, effect, bizarre licentiousness, and crass reproductions of ugly realities. Heyse did not yield. His sense of form was offended by their uncouth behaviour; he demanded that literature should see life in an ideal light that would transfigure reality. In his detailed and sensitive story\nMerlin\n(1892) he expressed his sense of injury in a manly way. Now the tide has turned again, and Heyse would probably have been proposed earlier by his country for the world prize had it not been for the partisan dislike of the naturalists. Now a miracle seems to have changed everything. The honourable veteran has been the object of admiration everywhere; he is an honorary citizen of Munich where a street has been named after him; he has been flooded with honours. To the manifold distinctions, the Swedish Academy, acting at the recommendation of many critics, has now added its token of admiration by presenting to the old poet the rare homage of the Nobel Prize.\nHeyse has gone his own ways. Aesthetically he has been faithful to truth, but in such a manner that he mirrored inner in external reality. Schiller’s well-known words, «Life is serious, art serene», properly understood, express a profound truth which can be found in the life and work of Heyse. Beauty should liberate and recreate: it should neither imitate reality slavishly nor drag it into the dust. It should have a noble simplicity. Heyse reveals beauty in this aspect. He does not teach morals, which would deprive beauty of its immediacy, but there is much wisdom and nobility in his works. He does not teach religion, but one would look in vain for anything that would seriously hurt religious feelings. Although he puts greater emphasis on the ethical than on the dogmatic side of religion, he has expressed his deep respect for every serious opinion. He is tolerant but not indifferent. He has praised love, but it was its heavenly and not its earthly aspect that he glorified. He likes men who are faithful to their nature, but the individuals to whom Heyse is most sympathetic adhere to their higher rather than their lower nature.\nOn this festive occasion, which Heyse has not been able to attend because of illness, we thank him for the joy that his works have given to thousands, and we send our regards to the house in the Louisenstrasse in Munich, which has been for so many years the home of the Muses: «GIaubt mir, es ist kein Märchen, die Quelle der Jugend sie rinnet/wirklich und immer. Ihr fraget, wo? ‹In der dichtenden Kunst.›»\nAt the banquet, Professor Oscar Montelius made the following comments: «I regret that we do not have the pleasure to see among us the great poet to whom this year’s Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded. But he is being worthily represented by the German Minister, Count von Pückler – and I ask you, Count, to assure him that, when toasts were proposed to the laureates, we did not forget him.»\nThe Minister, Count von Pückler, speaking in behalf of Paul Heyse, recalled that two years ago the Nobel Prize in Literature had been given to a German philosopher, this time to a popular poet. He attested to the lively exchange between Swedish and German literature, which had increased ever since the Swedish Academy became the Areopagus in charge of following closely the literary production of the entire world and of distributing the Nobel Prizes among the great masters of letters. He ended by paying his respect to the first of the international Areopaguses, the Swedish Academy.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1910 – Award ceremony speech.

Several among them presented such great and   unusual qualities that it has been very difficult to weigh their   respective merits. In giving this year’s award to Maurice   Maeterlinck, who has been proposed and seriously considered   several times before, the Swedish Academy has been determined   first by the profound originality and singularity of his talent   as a writer, so different from the usual forms of literature. The   idealistic character of this talent is elevated to a rare   spirituality and mysteriously causes delicate and secret strings   to vibrate in us. He is certainly not of a shallow nature, this   unusual man, who has not yet reached the age of fifty and who, as   an author, follows his own quite personal voice and possesses the   marvellous faculty of being at once mystical, profound, and   popular through the charm of his expression. While reading him   one sometimes recalls the words of Sophocles, «Man is only a   trivial shadow», or the words of Calderon that life is a   dream; and yet Maeterlinck knows how to render the fine nuances   of our moral life with the force of a visionary. What in ordinary   circumstances dwells in us latently and belongs to the secret   depths of our being, he calls up with the tap of a wand, and we   acknowledge that he has evoked features of our most intimate   being, which ordinarily remains hidden in a mysterious twilight.   He does it without affectation and mannerisms and mostly with an   unfailing sureness and classical refinement, although action and   scenery are often vague – like a Chinese shadow show – and in   keeping with the great subtlety of his poetry. Legendary and   fantastic as the narration may be, the dialogue is pointed. With   the sounds of muted music, the poet introduces us to unsuspected   regions of our inner being, and we feel with Goethe that   «Alles Vergängliche/Ist nur ein Gleichnis». We   have the foreboding that our true home is far away, well beyond   the limits of our earthly experiences. We hardly ever pass beyond   this foreboding with Maeterlinck, although his poetry opens for   us glimpses of inaccessible distances.\nMaurice Maeterlinck was born in 1862 at Ghent. His family appears   to have been well-to-do. He was educated at the Jesuit college of   Saint-Barbe. He did not like it, but this conventional school   probably influenced his intellectual development very strongly by   orienting him toward mysticism. After finishing school and   passing the baccalaureate, Maeterlinck followed the wishes of his   parents, read law, and established himself in Ghent as a lawyer.   But he succeeded, according to his biographer Gerard Harry, only   in demonstrating brilliantly his ineptitude for the legal career,   having the «happy defects» that render a man absolutely   unfit for the pettifogging quarrels and public counsel’s speeches   in the law court. He was attracted by literature, and this   attraction increased during a stay in Paris where he became   acquainted with a number of writers, one of whom, Villiers de   l’Isle Adam, apparently had a great influence on him. Paris   fascinated Maurice Maeterlinck so much that he established   himself there in 1896. Nonetheless, the great metropolis did not   really suit this solitary contemplative mind as a permanent place   to live. He goes there, from time to time, to deal with his   editors, but in the summer he likes to live at Saint-Wandrille,   an old Norman abbey which he bought and saved from imminent   vandalism. In the winter he seeks refuge in the mild climate of   the town of Grasse, known for its flowers.\nThe first work published by Maurice Maeterlinck was a slim   collection of verses entitled\nSerres chaudes\n(1889)   [Ardent Talons]. These poems appear more tormented than one would   have expected from his calmly meditative disposition. The same   year (1889) he published a dramatic fantasy,\nLa Princesse   Maleine\n. It is sombre, terrifying, and deliberately   monotonous due to numerous repetitions intended to give an   impression of duration; but a delightful fairy-tale charm reigns   in this little drama, which is written with a vigour one would   not have suspected in the author of the\nSerres chaudes\n. It   is in any case an important work of art.\nLa Princesse   Maleine\nwas enthusiastically praised by Octave Mirbeau in\nLe Figaro\n, and from that day on Maurice Maeterlinck was no   longer unknown. Later on, Maeterlinck wrote a whole series of   dramatic compositions. Most unfold in eras that we could not   determine and in places not to be found on any map. The scene is   usually a fairy castle with underground passages, a park with   lovely shady places, or a lighthouse with the sea in the   distance. In these melancholy regions figures often move veiled   like the idea itself. In several of his most perfect scenic   works, Maurice Maeterlinck is a symbolist and an agnostic; but   one should not conclude that he is a materialist. With the   instinct and imagination of the poet he feels that man does not   belong solely to the tangible world, and he expressly says that   poetry does not satisfy if it does not make us perceive a   reflection of the more profound and secret reality that is the   source of phenomena. Sometimes this background appears to him in   an obscure and misty fashion like an ensemble of occult powers of   which men are easily the victims, and he then attributes to the   occult force a fatal omnipotence that destroys our freedom. But   in several dramatic works he has mitigated this conception; he   has given more room to hope and to mixed mystic influences, less   to reality. The main idea which always dominates, especially in   his best works, is that the spiritual, real, intimate, and   profound life of man, which is manifested precisely in his most   spontaneous acts, must be sought in the realms beyond thought and   discursive reason. It is these acts which Maeterlinck excels in   representing with the almost somnambulant imaginative power and   dreaming spirit of a visionary but with the precision of a   perfect artist. At the same time the expression is stylized; the   simplification of the technique is pushed as far as possible   without harming the understanding of the drama.\nA more pronounced deism would have had a beneficial influence on   his dramas because it would have made them less similar to shadow   plays; but one should not disparage the creations of his genius.   Like Spinoza and Hegel, who were great thinkers though not   deists, Maeterlinck is a very great poet although his conception   of things and of life is not that of a deist. He does not deny   anything: he simply finds the principle of existence hidden in   the shadows. Besides, is not agnosticism in some degree   excusable, since no human reason could ever formulate an exact   notion of the origin of existence which in many aspects is   accessible only to intuition and to faith? And if Maurice   Maeterlinck’s characters are sometimes creatures of dreams, they   are still very human, for Shakespeare was not wrong in   stating:\nWe are such stuff\nAs dreams are made on, and our little life\nIs rounded with a sleep.\nBesides, Maeterlinck is in no way a   polemist; in almost all his works there breathes a sweet,   sometimes melancholy soul, so that in poetic beauty he excels   many writers whose conception of the world rests perhaps more on   the concept of personality. Maurice Maeterlinck is evidently a   man who has felt and thought profoundly. Homage must be rendered   to his sincere thirst for truth, and it must be remembered that   there exist for him a law and an inner right which invariably   command and direct man in the midst of a world where so many   things seem to encourage injustice. If Maurice Maeterlinck, who   has passed through so many stages of inner development, sometimes   speaks of «gravitation» as the power that rules the   world, and apparently wants to substitute it for religion, one   would hardly be wrong (considering his symbolism) in taking the   word «gravitation» as a symbolic expression of that law   of religio-ethical gravity to which, if I may say so, all are   obedient.\nThere is no time to list all of Maeterlinck’s works; however, it   seems right to me on this solemn occasion to recall very briefly   the most characteristic ones.\nThe pitiless, mysterious power of death has rarely been rendered   in more poignant fashion than in Maeterlinck’s little piece,\nL’Intruse\n(1890) [\nThe Intruder\n]. Among all those   who surround the sick mother and who hope for her recovery, only   the old blind grandfather notices furtive and sliding steps in   the garden where the cyprus trees are beginning to rustle and   where the nightingale is hushed; he feels a cold breeze pass, he   hears a scythe being whetted, he reckons that someone invisible   to the others has entered to sit in their circle. On the stroke   of midnight there is a noise as if someone had suddenly stood up   and gone away; at the same instant the sick one dies. The guest   no one can escape has passed there. The portent is described with   great force and subtlety. The short play\nLes Aveugles\n(1890) [\nThe Blind\n], which shows the same foreboding of   disaster, is perhaps even more melancholy. The sightless have   followed their guide, an old sick priest; and there in the middle   of the forest they believe they have lost him. In reality he is   in the middle of them but he is dead. Little by little they   realize his death. How will they now find their refuge?\nIn\nPelléas et Mélisande\n(1892) and\nAlladine   et Palomides\n(1894) we find in different variants the fatal   power of love which Maeterlinck describes with a fantastic   imagination – that love which, fettered by other bonds or by   external circumstances, neither could nor should attain a happy   ending, but which is crushed by a fatality against which human   strength breaks.\nThe most inspired of Maeterlinck’s dramas is unquestionably his\nAglavaine et Sélysette\n(1896), one of the purest   jewels in world literature. This play is deeply melancholic but   contains poetic treasures. Méléandre, who has married   the sweet, timid Sélysette, begins to love the noble   Aglavaine, a love Aglavaine returns. Theirs is a pure love which   raises them above the common lot. But Sélysette suffers from   not possessing Méléandre’s heart alone. The tender   creature, full of abnegation, resolves to sacrifice herself for   the happiness of her husband and Aglavaine. She leans so far out   of the embrasures of an old turret that a crumbling part of the   wall collapses and Sélysette falls, not into the sea as she   had thought, but onto the sand of the beach. Wounded, she is   carried to the house, and even on the verge of death she is   unselfish; wishing to spare them remorse, she tries to pretend to   Méléandre and Aglavaine that her fall from the tower   was accidental. In this drama in which delicately shaded states   of soul abound, all the characters are noble and generous. Both   Aglavaine and Méléandre feel that a happiness that is   purchased at the price of another’s suffering is fugitive and   vain and, if they do not feel less irresistibly drawn to one   another, they do not by any means yield to low desires but to a   powerful, spiritualized attraction. They struggle against fate, a   struggle all the more painful as they well suspect that fraternal   love will ultimately be impossible and that everything will lead   them to the complete union which they flee as a sin. These words   of Aglavaine are beautiful: «If somebody must suffer, it   should be us. There are a thousand duties, but I think one is   rarely mistaken in the attempt to relieve a weaker creature by   taking its suffering upon oneself» This play has a charm   which ranks it among the most beautiful poetic creations of the   century.\nAglavaine et Sélysette\n, Maeterlinck’s masterpiece,   appeared in 1896. In 1902 the author published the drama of\nMonna Vanna\n, known and played even here in Sweden. The   action takes place against the historical background of the   Renaissance in Italy; its composition is very clear-cut and   entirely free from that kind of twilight which generally   characterizes Maeterlink’s art. The dramatic idea of duty which   sustains the action has often been disputed, with very diverse   opinions. The play is certainly bold and of great psychological   interest, but Maeterlinck is perhaps more himself in the short,   delicately symbolic plays in which the great, flooding light of   day does not hold sway but which open up marvellous perspectives   for the most intimate presentiments of the human heart.\nMaurice Maeterlinck, a many-sided writer, has written works of a   philosophical nature, if not purely philosophical works. Such,   for example, is\nLe Trésor des humbles\n(1896) [\nThe   Treasure of the Humble\n] which, among other interesting   studies, contains inspired pages about the mystic Ruysbrock and   about the spiritual life. Maeterlinck’s idealism finds a happy   expression here in his words on the most exalted poetry, which,   he says, aims at keeping open the principal paths which lead from   the visible to the invisible world. In many places in this book   appears the thought mentioned earlier that there is behind our   visible self another self which is our true being. This idea may   appear mystical to the empiricists; at bottom it is quite as   plausible as Kant’s doctrine of intelligibility which, after all,   is the source of the empirical character. In\nLe Temple   enseveli\n(1902) [\nThe Buried Temple\n] is found the idea   of an invisible personality, the basis of the visible and earthly   personality. If, however, Maeterlinck is accused of fatalism, one   should remember the glowing optimism of his book\nLa Sagesse et   la destinée\n(1893) [\nWisdom and Destiny\n], in which   man’s fate is said to reside in himself and to depend on the way   in which he exercises his will. The downfall of great historical   personages is represented here as caused by their own faults or   originating from the fact that they lost their old confidence in   themselves through errors, and indeed through evil actions, and   thereby lost the strength to combat perils victoriously.\nIn 1900\nLa Vie des abeilles\n[\nThe Life of the Bee\n]   appeared. This book had strong repercussions. Although Maurice   Maeterlinck is an enthusiastic beekeeper and thoroughly familiar   with the life of the bees, he did not intend to write a   scientific treatise. His book is not an abstract of natural   history but an exuberantly poetic work abounding in reflections,   the sum total of which is almost a declaration of incompetence.   It is useless, the author seems to say, to inquire if the strange   cooperation among the bees, their apportionment of work, and   their social life are the product of a reasoning mind. It matters   little whether the term «instinct» or the term   «intelligence» is used, for they are but ways of   revealing our ignorance in the matter. What we call instinct   among the bees is perhaps of a cosmic nature, the emanation of a   universal soul. One immediately thinks of Virgil’s immortal   description of the bees in which he says that a thinker   attributes to them a share of\ndivina mens\n, the divine   thought, the divine spirit.\nL’Intelligence des fleurs\n(1907) [\nThe Intelligence of   Flowers\n], another of Maeterlinck’s works, is interesting for   its bold representation of plants as having wisdom and   self-interest. Here one finds the same richness of poetic   imagination and, occasionally, profound reflections.\nWith his creative force, which never runs dry, Maeterlinck   composed in 1903 the fascinating dramatic phantasy\nJoyzelle\n, which shows, through difficult trials and sombre   episodes, the triumph of love faithful to its own nature.\nMarie Magdeleine\n(1909) represents the change in the soul   of the repentant sinner and her victory over a temptation that   was all the stronger as it touched precisely the noblest side of   her nature and urged her to save the Messiah at the sacrifice of   herself and of the new moral life which he himself had created in   her; that is to say, at the sacrifice of the vital work of the   Messiah. Finally, we admire the spectacle\nL’Oiseau bleu\n(1909) [\nThe Blue Bird\n], a profound fairy tale which   sparkles with the poetry of childhood, even if it seems to   include too much reflection to have quite enough naive   spontaneity. Alas! the blue bird of happiness exists only beyond   the limits of this perishable world, but those who have pure   hearts will never seek it in vain, for their emotional lives and   their imaginations will enrich them and purify them in their   journey across the countries of the land of dreams.\nAnd so we return to the place we started from, the land of   dreams. Perhaps we would not be wrong in saying that for Maurice   Maeterlinck, all reality in time and space, even when it is not a   product of the imagination, always carries a veil woven of   dreams. Under this veil is hidden the real truth of existence,   and when the veil is lifted someday, the essence of things will   be discovered.\nI have tried to give an account of Maeterlinck’s conception of   life, using his works as a guide. One cannot doubt the beauty and   nobility of this conception; moreover, it is presented in the   original form of a poetry that is strange and sometimes bizarre   but always inspired.\nMaurice Maeterlinck belongs to the chosen ones in the field of   poetry. Tastes may change, but the charm of\nAglavaine et   Sélysette\nwill remain. Today Sweden, the land of sagas   and folk songs, offers her world prize to the poet who has made   us perceive the tender vibrations of the melody that is hidden in   the hearts of men.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

If we look back on past ages we   discover its truth. We, who are no longer young, have had the   opportunity in our bustling lives to experience the truth of the   saying, and every day confirms it anew. As far back as history   extends we find that new things emerged, but were not at first   recognized although they were to be important in the future. A   seed came alive and grew to magnificent size. Certain names in   contemporary science illustrate the discrepancy between modest   beginnings and later developments.\nThe same is true of dramatic poetry. This is not the place to   trace its development through twenty-five centuries. There is a   tremendous difference, however, between the satyr choruses of the   Dionysiac festivals, called tragedies because of the goat skins   worn by the chorus, and the demands the modern age makes on   dramatic poetry, and this difference indicates considerable   progress.\nIn our time Gerhart Hauptmann has been a great name in the field   of drama. He turned fifty recently; he is thus in his prime of   life and can look back on an exceptionally rich career as an   artist. He submitted his first work to the stage at the age of   twenty-seven. At the age of thirty he proved himself a mature   artist with his play\nDie Weber\n(1892) [\nThe   Weavers\n]. This work was followed by others which confirmed   his reputation. In most of his plays he deals with conditions of   the low-class life which he had numerous occasions to study,   especially in his native Silesia. His descriptions are based on   keen observations of man and his milieu. Each of his characters   is a fully developed personality – there is not a trace of types   or clichés. Nobody even for a moment could doubt the   truthfulness of his observations; they have established Hauptmann   as a great realist. But he nowhere praises the life of these   so-called low characters. On the contrary, when one has seen or   read these plays and identified himself deeply with the   conditions they represent, he feels the need for fresh air and   asks how such misery can be abolished in the future. The realism   in Hauptmann’s plays leads necessarily to brighter dreams of new   and better conditions and to the wish for their fulfilment.\nHauptmann has also written dramas of a totally different nature:   he calls them «Märchendramen». Among them is the   delightful\nHanneles Himmelfahrt\n(1893) [\nThe Assumption   of Hannele\n], in which the misery of life and the bliss of   heaven emerge with such striking contrast. Among these plays is   also\nDie versunkene Glocke\n(1897) [\nThe Sunken   Bell\n], the most popular of his plays in his own country. The   copy used by the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy bore the   stamp of the sixtieth impression.\nHauptmann has also distinguished himself in the genres of   historical drama and comedy. He has not published a collection of   his lyrical poems, but incidental poems in his plays bear witness   to his talent in this field.\nIn his early years he had published a few short stories, but in   1910 he brought out his novel\nDer Narr in Christo Emanuel   Quint\n[\nThe Fool in Christ: Emanuel Quint\n], the result   of many years of work. The story «Der Apostel» of 1892   is a sketch of the final work in which we learn about the inner   life of a poor man who, without any education other than that   acquired from the Bible and without any critical judgment of what   he has read, finally reaches the conclusion that he is the   reincarnation of Christ. It is not easy to give a correct account   of the development of a human soul that can be considered normal,   in view of all the forces and circumstances that affect its   development. But it is even more difficult to attain the truth if   one describes the inner development of a soul that is in certain   respects abnormal. The attempt is bold; its execution took   decades of creative work. Judgment of the work has differed   widely. I am happy to join the many who consider\nEmanuel   Quint\na masterly solution of a difficult problem.\nHauptmann’s particular virtue is his penetrating and critical   insight into the human soul. It is this gift that enabled him in   his plays and in his novels to create truly living individuals   rather than types representing some particular outlook or   opinion. All the characters we meet, even the minor ones, have a   full life. In his novels one admires the descriptions of the   setting, as well as the sketches of the people that come in more   or less close contact with the protagonist of the story. The   plays reveal his great art by their powerful concentration which   holds the reader or spectator from beginning to end. Whatever   subject he treats, even when he deals with life’s seamy side, his   is always a noble personality. That nobility and his refined art   give his works their wonderful power.\nThe preceding remarks were intended to sketch the reasons why the   Swedish Academy has awarded this year’s Nobel Prize to Gerhart   Hauptmann.\nDr. Hauptmann – In your significant and controversial book\nDer   Narr in Christo Emanuel Quint\nyou say: «It is impossible   to uncover the necessary course of a human life in all its   stages, if only because every human being is something unique   from beginning to end and because the observer can comprehend his   object only within the limits of his own nature.»\nThat is indeed true. But there are many kinds of observers. The   everyday man in the midst of his bustling life has neither the   opportunity nor the will to study his fellow men in greater   depth. We see the outside but do not care to see beneath it   unless we happen to have a special interest in learning another’s   motives. Even those who are not drawn into the turmoil of present   life, who limit their intercourse with the outside world and are   on intimate terms with their immediate surroundings, do not   generally go very far in their study of the human soul. We are   attracted or repelled; we love or hate, if we are not   indifferent. We praise or blame.\nThe poet, however, is not an everyday man. He is able to extend   the scope of his imagination much further. For he has the divine   gift of intuition. And you, Dr. Hauptmann, possess this wonderful   gift to the highest degree. In your many works you have created   innumerable characters. But they do not exist merely as so many   types of such and such a nature. To the reader and spectator of   your plays, each of your characters is a fully developed   individual, living and acting together with others, but different   from all of them. That is the reason for much of the magic of   your work.\nIt has been said that at least in some of your works you have   been a marked realist. You have had rich opportunities to use   your gift of observation and become acquainted with the misery of   whole classes of people, and you have described it faithfully. If   after seeing or reading such a play one is deeply moved by it, he   cannot help thinking, «These conditions must be   improved.» One cannot deny the existence of the seamy side   of life, and it must have its place in literature in order to   teach wisdom to the living.\nYour manifold activities as a writer have given us other   marvellous works. I shall mention only two here,\nHanneles   Himmefahrt\nand\nDie versunkene Glocke\n. The latter seems   to enjoy great popularity in your country.\nThrough the mouth of the ambitious and unfortunate Michael Kramer   you say:\nIf someone has the effrontery to paint the man with the crown   of thorns – it will take him a lifetime to do it. No pleasures   for him: lonely hours, lonely days, lonely years. He must be   alone with himself and with his God. He must consecrate himself   daily. Nothing common must be about him or in him. And then when   he struggles and toils in his solitude the Holy Ghost comes. Then   he can sometimes catch a glimpse. It swells, he can feel it. Then   he rests in the eternal and he has it before him in quiet and   beauty. He has it without wanting it. He sees the Saviour. He   feels him.\nAlthough in your work you have not represented the Saviour with   the crown of thorns, you have represented a poor man ultimately   driven to the delusion that he is the second Christ. But Kramer’s   words reflect your own attitude. Your novel\nDer Narr in   Christo Emanuel Quint\nappeared in 1910, but the story   «Der Apostel» of 1892 shows that the plan for writing   the novel had occurred to you twenty years earlier.\nTrue art does not consist in writing down and handing to the   public the thoughts of the moment, but rather in subjecting   potentially useful ideas to close scrutiny, to the conflict of   different opinions and the apprehensive consideration of their   eventual effect. This process will gradually lead the true artist   to the precious conviction, «I have finally reached the   truth.» You have attained the highest rank of art by   painstaking but never pedantic preparatory research, by the   consistency of your feelings, thoughts, and actions, and by the   strict form of your plays.\nThe Swedish Academy has found the great artist Gerhart Hauptmann   worthy of receiving this year’s Nobel Prize, which his Majesty   the King will now present to him.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

There was even less reason since the founder of the Prize laid it down in set terms as his «express wish and desire that, in the awarding of the Prize, no consideration should be paid to the nationality to which any proposed candidate might belong.»\nTagore’s\nGitanjali: Song Offerings\n(1912), a collection of religious poems, was the one of his works that especially arrested the attention of the selecting critics. Since last year the book, in a real and full sense, has belonged to English literature, for the author himself, who by education and practice is a poet in his native Indian tongue, has bestowed upon the poems a new dress, alike perfect in form and personally original in inspiration. This has made them accessible to all in England, America, and the entire Western world for whom noble literature is of interest and moment. Quite independently of any knowledge of his Bengali poetry, irrespective, too, of differences of religious faiths, literary schools, or party aims, Tagore has been hailed from various quarters as a new and admirable master of that poetic art which has been a never-failing concomitant of the expansion of British civilization ever since the days of Queen Elizabeth. The features of this poetry that won immediate and enthusiastic admiration are the perfection with which the poet’s own ideas and those he has borrowed have been harmonized into a complete whole; his rhythmically balanced style, that, to quote an English critic’s opinion, «combines at once the feminine grace of poetry with the virile power of prose»; his austere, by some termed classic, taste in the choice of words and his use of the other elements of expression in a borrowed tongue – those features, in short, that stamp an original work as such, but which at the same time render more difficult its reproduction in another language.\nThe same estimate is true of the second cycle of poems that came before us,\nThe Gardener, Lyrics of Love and Life\n(1913). In this work, however, as the author himself points out, he has recast rather than interpreted his earlier inspirations. Here we see another phase of his personality, now subject to the alternately blissful and torturing experiences of youthful love, now prey to the feelings of longing and joy that the vicissitudes of life give rise to, the whole interspersed nevertheless with glimpses of a higher world.\nEnglish translations of Tagore’s prose stories have been published under the title\nGlimpses of Bengal Life\n(1913). Though the form of these tales does not bear his own stamp – the rendering being by another hand – their content gives evidence of his versatility and wide range of observation, of his heartfelt sympathy with the fates and experiences of differing types of men, and of his talent for plot construction and development.\nTagore has since published both a collection of poems, poetic pictures of childhood and home life, symbolically entitled\nThe Crescent Moon\n(1913), and a number of lectures given before American and English university audiences, which in book form he calls\nSâdhanâ: The Realisation of Life\n(1913). They embody his views of the ways in which man can arrive at a faith in the light of which it may be possible to live. This very seeking of his to discover the true relation between faith and thought makes Tagore stand out as a poet of rich endowment, characterized by his great profundity of thought, but most of all by his warmth of feeling and by the moving power of his figurative language. Seldom indeed in the realm of imaginative literature are attained so great a range and diversity of note and of colour, capable of expressing with equal harmony and grace the emotions of every mood from the longing of the soul after eternity to the joyous merriment prompted by the innocent child at play.\nConcerning our understanding of this poetry, by no means exotic but truly universally human in character, the future will probably add to what we know now. We do know, however, that the poet’s motivation extends to the effort of reconciling two spheres of civilization widely separated, which above all is the characteristic mark of our present epoch and constitutes its most important task and problem. The true inwardness of this work is most clearly and purely revealed in the efforts exerted in the Christian mission-field throughout the world. In times to come, historical inquirers will know better how to appraise its importance and influence, even in what is at present hidden from our gaze and where no or only grudging recognition is accorded. They will undoubtedly form a higher estimate of it than the one now deemed fitting in many quarters. Thanks to this movement, fresh, bubbling springs of living water have been tapped, from which poetry in particular may draw inspiration, even though those springs are perhaps intermingled with alien streams, and whether or not they be traced to their right source or their origin be attributed to the depths of the dreamworld. More especially, the preaching of the Christian religion has provided in many places the first definite impulse toward a revival and regeneration of the vernacular language, i.e., its liberation from the bondage of an artificial tradition, and consequently also toward a development of its capacity for nurturing and sustaining a vein of living and natural poetry.\nThe Christian mission has exercised its influence as a rejuvenating force in India, too, where in conjunction with religious revivals many of the vernaculars were early put to literary use, thereby acquiring status and stability. However, with only too regular frequency, they fossilized again under pressure from the new tradition that gradually established itself. But the influence of the Christian mission has extended far beyond the range of the actually registered proselytizing work. The struggle that the last century witnessed between the living vernaculars and the sacred language of ancient times for control over the new literatures springing into life would have had a very different course and outcome, had not the former found able support in the fostering care bestowed upon them by the self-sacrificing missionaries.\nIt was in Bengal, the oldest Anglo-Indian province and the scene many years before of the indefatigable labours of that missionary pioneer, Carey, to promote the Christian religion and to improve the vernacular language, that Rabindranath Tagore was born in 1861. He was a scion of a respected family that had already given evidence of intellectual ability in many areas. The surroundings in which the boy and young man grew up were in no sense primitive or calculated to hem in his conceptions of the world and of life. On the contrary, in his home there prevailed, along with a highly cultivated appreciation of art, a profound reverence for the inquiring spirit and wisdom of the forefathers of the race, whose texts were used for family devotional worship. Around him, too, there was then coming into being a new literary spirit that consciously sought to reach forth to the people and to make itself acquainted with their life needs. This new spirit gained in force as reforms ere firmly effected by the Government, after the quelling of the widespread, confused Indian Mutiny.\nRabindranath’s father was one of the leading and most zealous members of a religious community to which his son still belongs. That body, known by the name of «Brahmo Samaj», did not arise as a sect of the ancient Hindu type, with the purpose of spreading the worship of some particular godhead as superior to all others. Rather, it was founded in the early part of the nineteenth century by an enlightened and influential man who had been much impressed by the doctrines of Christianity, which he had studied also in England. He endeavoured to give to the native Hindu traditions, handed down from the past, an interpretation in agreement with what he conceived to be the spirit and import of the Christian faith. Doctrinal controversy has since been rife regarding the interpretation of truth that he and his successors were thus led to give, whereby the community has been subdivided into a number of independent sects. The character, too, of the community, appealing essentially to highly trained intellectual minds, has from its inception always precluded any large growth of the numbers of its avowed adherents. Nevertheless, the indirect influence exercised by the body, even upon the development of popular education and literature, is held to be very considerable indeed. Among those community members who have grown up in recent years, Rabindranath Tagore has laboured to a pre-eminent degree. To them he has stood as a revered master and prophet. That intimate interplay of teacher and pupil so earnestly sought after has attained a deep, hearty, and simple manifestation, both in religious life and in literary training.\nTo carry out his life’s work Tagore equipped himself with a many-sided culture, European as well as Indian, extended and matured by travels abroad and by advanced study in London. In his youth he travelled widely in his own land, accompanying his father as far as the Himalayas. He was still quite young when he began to write in Bengali, and he has tried his hand in prose and poetry, lyrics and dramas. In addition to his descriptions of the life of he common people of his own country, he has dealt in separate works with questions in literary criticism, philosophy, and sociology. At one period, some time ago, there occurred a break in the busy round of his activities, for he then felt obliged, in accord with immemorial practice among his race, to pursue for a time a contemplative hermit life in a boat floating on the waters of a tributary of the sacred Ganges River. After he returned to ordinary life, his reputation among his own people as a man of refined wisdom and chastened piety grew greater from day to day. The open-air school which he established in western Bengal, beneath the sheltering branches of the mango tree, has brought up numbers of youths who as devoted disciples have spread his teaching throughout the land. To this place he has now retired, after spending nearly a year as an honoured guest in the literary circles of England and America and attending the Religious History Congress held in Paris last summer (1913).\nWherever Tagore has encountered minds open to receive his high teaching, the reception accorded him has been that suited to a bearer of good tidings which are delivered, in language intelligible to all, from that treasure house of the East whose existence had long been conjectured. His own attitude, moreover, is that he is but the intermediary, giving freely of that to which by birth he has access. He is not at all anxious to shine before men as a genius or as an inventor of some new thing. In contrast to the cult of work, which is the product of life in the fenced-in cities of the Western world, with its fostering of a restless, contentious spirit; in contrast to its struggle to conquer nature for the love of gain and profit, «as if we are living», Tagore says, «in a hostile world where we have to wrest everything we want from an unwilling and alien arrangement of things» (\nSâdhanâ\n, p. 5); in contrast to all that enervating hurry and scurry, he places before us the culture that in the vast, peaceful, and enshrining forests of India attains its perfection, a culture that seeks primarily the quiet peace of the soul in ever-increasing harmony with the life of nature herself It is a poetical, not a historical, picture that Tagore here reveals to us to confirm his promise that a peace awaits us, too. By virtue of the right associated with the gift of prophecy, he freely depicts the scenes that have loomed before his creative vision at a period contemporary with the beginning of time.\nHe is, however, as far removed as anyone in our midst from all that we are accustomed to hear dispensed and purveyed in the market places as Oriental philosophy, from painful dreams about the transmigration of souls and the impersonal\nkarma\n, from the pantheistic, and in reality abstract, belief that is usually regarded as peculiarly characteristic of the higher civilization in India. Tagore himself is not even prepared to admit that a belief of that description can claim any authority from the profoundest utterances of the wise men of the past. He peruses his Vedic hymns, his\nUpanishads\n, and indeed the theses of Buddha himself, in such a manner that he discovers in them, what is for him an irrefutable truth. If he seeks the divinity in nature, he finds there a living personality with the features of omnipotence, the all-embracing lord of nature, whose preternatural spiritual power nevertheless likewise reveals its presence in all temporal life, small as well as great, but especially in the soul of man predestined for eternity. Praise, prayer, and fervent devotion pervade the song offerings that he lays at the feet of this nameless divinity of his. Ascetic and even ethic austerity would appear to be alien to his type of divinity worship, which may be characterized as a species of aesthetic theism. Piety of that description is in full concord with the whole of his poetry, and it has bestowed peace upon him. He proclaims the coming of that peace for weary and careworn souls even within the bounds of Christendom.\nThis is mysticism, if we like to call it so, but not a mysticism that, relinquishing personality, seeks to become absorbed in an All that approaches a Nothingness, but one that, with all the talents and faculties of the soul trained to their highest pitch, eagerly sets forth to meet the living Father of the whole creation. This more strenuous type of mysticism was not wholly unknown even in India before the days of Tagore, hardly indeed among the ascetics and philosophers of ancient times but rather in the many forms of\nbhakti\n, a piety whose very essence is the profound love of and reliance upon God. Ever since the Middle Ages, influenced in some measure by the Christian and other foreign religions,\nbhakti\nhas sought the ideals of its faith in the different phases of Hinduism, varied in character but each to all intents monotheistic in conception. All those higher forms of faith have disappeared or have been depraved past recognition, choked by the superabundant growth of that mixture of cults that has attracted to its banner all those Indian peoples who lacked an adequate power of resistance to its blandishments. Even though Tagore may have borrowed one or another note from the orchestral symphonies of his native predecessors, yet he treads upon firmer ground in this age that draws the peoples of the earth closer together along paths of peace, and of strife too, to joint and collective responsibilities, and that spends its own energies in dispatching greetings and good wishes far over land and sea. Tagore, though, in thought-impelling pictures, has shown us how all things temporal are swallowed up in the eternal:\nTime is endless in thy hands, my lord.\nThere is none to count thy minutes.\nDays and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to wait.\nThy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.\nWe have no time to lose, and having no time, we must scramble for our chances. We are too poor to be late.\nAnd thus it is that time goes by, while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.\nAt the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut; but if I find that yet there is time.\n(Gitanjali, 82.)\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

He studied literature,   music, and philosophy, and in 1895 he published two doctoral   theses:\nLes Origines du théâtre lyrique moderne\n,   an erudite and penetrating work which was awarded a prize by the   French Academy, and a Latin thesis,\nCur ars picturae apud   Italos XVI saeculi deciderit\n, a study of the decline of   Italian painting in the sixteenth century. After several tiresome   years as a schoolmaster, he was appointed to the École   Normale as\nmaître de conférences\nand thereafter   (1903) to the Sorbonne, where until 1910 he gave a remarkable   course on the history of music. In addition to his duties at the   university, he devoted himself to music criticism during these   years and acquired a wide reputation not only in France but all   over Europe when he published his articles and reviews in book   form under the titles\nMusiciens d’autrefois\n(1908)   [\nSome Musicians of Former Days\n] and\nMusiciens   d’aujourd’hui\n(1908) [\nMusicians of Today\n]. They reveal   him as a critic of great judgment, both fair and bold, without   prejudices or allegiance to any one party, and as one always   striving to reach through music the very sources of life. His   biographies of Beethoven (1903) and Händel (1910), inspired   as well as learned, are proof of his understanding of music.   Besides these, he has written equally remarkable biographies of   François Millet (1902), Michelangelo (1905-06), and Tolstoi   (1911), in which he has stressed the heroic character of the   lives and talents of these artists.\nRolland made his debut in pure literature in 1897 with a play in   five acts,\nSaint-Louis\n, which he published together with\nAërt\n(1898) and\nLe Triomphe de la raison\n(1899), under the common title\nLes Tragédies de la   foi\n(1909) [Tragedies of Faith]. In these plays he sought to   set forth, under the mask of historical events, the miseries that   souls faithful to their ideals meet in their struggle with the   world. He also wrote\nThéâtre de la   révolution\n(1909), which includes\nLe 14 Juillet\n(1902),\nDanton\n(1900),\nLes Loups\n(1898) [\nThe   Wolves\n], and a pacifist drama about the war in the Transvaal,\nLe Temps viendra\n(1903) [\nThe Time Will Come\n]. The   plays about the Revolution were conceived during a period when   Rolland dreamed of a dramatic reform. He wanted to create a new   theatre, to free the art from the domination of a selfish clique,   and to entrust it to the people. He had previously outlined his   ideas in an essay called\nLe Théâtre du peuple\n(1900-03) [\nThe People’s Theatre\n]. He tried to make his own   contribution to this new popular drama by describing the   principal episodes of the French Revolution and by representing   in a dramatic cycle the Iliad of the French nation. These dramas,   which seek moral truth at the sacrifice of anecdotal color,   reveal historical intuition, and their characters are fully   alive. They are very interesting to read and deserve to be   staged.\nFrom 1904 to 1912 Rolland published his great novel\nJean-Christophe\n, which is composed of a series of   independent narratives:\nL’Aube\n,\nLe Matin\n,\nL’Adolescent\n,\nLa Révolte\n,\nLa Foire sur la   place\n,\nAntoinette\n,\nDans la maison\n,\nLes   Amies\n,\nLe Buisson ardent\n, and\nLa Nouvelle   Journée\n[\nDawn, Morning, Youth, Revolt, The Market   Place, Antoinette, The House, Love and Friendship, The Burning   Bush, The New Dawn\n]. In 1910 he resigned from his duties at   the University; since then he has devoted himself entirely to   writing, living most of the time in Rome and Switzerland. During   the war, he wrote a series of articles in Swiss newspapers; these   were subsequently published in a volume called\nAu-dessus de la   mêlée\n(1915) [\nAbove the Battle\n]. In this, he   maintains that the future of mankind is superior to the interests   of nations. War for him is barbarous violence, and over the   bloody struggles of nations which seek power he turns our eyes   toward the cause of humanity. Rolland’s recent works are a novel,\nColas Breugnon\n(1918), a dramatic fantasy,\nLiluli\n(1919), and a study of Empedocles (1917).\nRomain Rolland’s masterpiece, for which he has received the Nobel   Prize in Literature in 1915, is\nJean-Christophe\n. This   powerful work describes the development of a character in whom we   can recognize ourselves. It shows how an artistic temperament, by   raising itself step by step, emerges like a genius above the   level of humanity; how a powerful nature which has the noblest   and most urgent desire for truth, moral health, and artistic   purity, with an exuberant love of life, is forced to overcome   obstacles that rise up ceaselessly before it; how it attains   victory and independence; and how this character and this   intelligence are significant enough to concentrate in themselves   a complete image of the world. This book does not aim solely at   describing the life of the principal hero and his environment. It   seeks also to describe the causes of the tragedy of a whole   generation; it gives a sweeping picture of the secret labour that   goes on in the hidden depths and by which nations, little by   little, are enlightened; it covers all the domains of life and   art; it contains everything essential that has been discussed or   attempted in the intellectual world during the last decades; it   achieves a new musical aesthetic; it contains sociological,   political and ethnological, biological, literary, and artistic   discussions and judgments, often of the highest interest. The   artistic personality which is revealed in\nJean-Christophe\nis one of rare resoluteness and strong moral structure. In this   work Rolland has not simply followed a literary impulse; he does   not write to please or to delight. He has been compelled to write   by his thirst for truth, his need for morality, and his love of   humanity. For him the purpose of the aesthetic life consists not   merely in the creation of beauty; it is an act of humanism.\nJean-Christophe\nis a profession of faith and an example;   it is a combination of thought and poetry, of reality and symbol,   of life and dream, which attracts us, excites us, reveals us to   ourselves, and possesses a liberating power because it is the   expression of a great moral force.\nIn addition to the Romain Rolland who is concerned about truth   and altruism there is also the artist. He is a poet of great   scope. Although he has assigned the novel only to second place in   his work, his mastery of the genre is superb. The character study   of Jean-Christophe is an inspired creation, astonishing in   spontaneity, with individuality in every trait, every movement,   every thought.\nAround this central, monumental figure, we find a whole series of   characters of great human interest. Rolland’s observation is   precise and profound. He penetrates to the depths of the beings   whom he describes; he studies their characters and paints their   souls with incomparable psychological art. His portraits of   women, especially, are masterpieces. His characters come from all   walks of life and are astonishingly true to type – the bourgeois,   the politician, the artist. Sometimes the descriptions are brief   but powerful sketches full of drama and pathos; sometimes they   are extended to form immense tableaux of manners that are   striking because of their keenness of vision and their singular   penetration. His innate sincerity prevents Rolland from using   rhetorical devices. He says in an exact and natural manner what   he has to say – and nothing more. But when his thought is   inflamed, when his heart is filled with emotion-love, anger,   enthusiasm, scorn, joy, or sadness – then a wind swells the   sentence and gives to the text a beauty that, before Rolland,   only the greatest masters of French prose have attained.\nThe author of\nJean-Christophe\nis one of the most imposing   literary figures of the contemporary era; he is a mighty spirit   and an original poet. His masterpiece has taken its place in   world literature among the most original, the boldest, and the   healthiest works of our century.\nThe works of Romain Rolland (1866-1945)   written after the First World War continued to reflect all his   earlier interests. During the twenties he began another   «roman fleuve»,\nL’Ame enchantée\n(7 vols.,   1922-33) [\nThe Soul Enchanted\n]. Music and the problem of   the artist are the subject of his\nBeethoven: Les grandes   époques créatrices\n(1928) [\nBeethoven the   Creator\n]. Rolland persisted in his quest for peace and was   attracted by the non-violence movement of Ghandi, about whom he   wrote a book (1924). His fascination with India and Buddhism led   to the study\nEssai sur la mystique et l’action de L’Inde   vivante\n(1929-30) [\nProphets of the New India\n]. His   political ideas were increasingly influenced by socialism, as is   evident from his many essays. Other works of his later period are\nLes Précurseurs\n(1919) [\nThe Forerunners\n],\nClerambault: histoire d’une conscience libre pendant la   guerre\n(1920) [\nClerambault\n],\nLe Jeu de l’amour et   de la mort\n(1925) [\nThe Game of Love and Death\n], and\nPéguy\n(1944), the study of his boyhood friend.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\n*\nThe Nobel Prize   in Literature 1915 was announced on November 9, 1916.\nRomain Rolland died on December 30, 1944.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Presentation.

He was the   leader of the generation of poets of 1890; he was the first to   set forth in theory and also to realize in his works the ideal of   new Swedish generations. Even in his first poems he opened new   paths for imagination and form; and his later collections are in   large part pure masterpieces of the lyric art. Not less   significant – but more impressive because of its great dimensions   – is his work in prose. Inspired by national subjects from the   very beginning, it succeeds in capturing the most genuine   characteristics of national life; it depicts the destinies of the   Swedish people in epic poems, which by the richness of their   imagination, the sharpness of their contours, and their   composition, are works of the highest order in Scandinavian   literature. No competent and impartial judge has ever questioned   the rare originality of his genius, and Heidenstam has long been   ranked among the masters of Swedish national literature.\nBorn in 1859 into an old family of the Swedish nobility, he first   wanted to be a painter, but he abandoned the study of painting to   devote himself to his vocation as a poet. His first collection of   poems, Vallfart och vandringsår (1888) [\nPilgrimage: The   Wander Years\n], which contains predominantly Oriental themes,   marked an epoch in the modern literature of Sweden. In truth it   gave the final blow to the realistic school, enemy of all   imagination, which was then dominant in Sweden and which since   1880 had darkened literature with its sadness and its gloom. This   was the first manifestation of a new poetry in which free   individuals, led only by the logic of their imagination,   worshipped beauty for its own sake. This «renaissance»,   which a small polemical work (\nRenässans\n, 1889)   announced a little later, was already completely realized in   these poems, rich in colours and bold in form. They reaffirmed   the right of man to the naive pleasure of living and surprised   with their new rhythms and their poetic accents.\nThe Oriental poems which played so charmingly with colours and   forms had inaugurated a new era and had made the renewal of   Swedish poetry apparent to the eyes and to the imagination. In   the great prose-poem intermixed with verse,\nHans Alienus\n(1892), the tragic Odyssey of an uprooted worshipper of beauty,   and especially in his\nDikter\n(1895) [Poems] Heidenstam   opens perspectives to an inner life. The time of hymns to   voluptuousness is past; gravity and sadness are now persistent   moods. Sentiment and duty are appreciated at their just value and   what is firmly rooted in the depths of the human personality   finds itself intuitively explained. What is characteristic in   this conception of life, born of noble and unhappy experiences,   is a proud and tolerant virility which constitutes the very   essence of the suffering, the hope, and the intoxication of the   poet, and a newly acquired capacity to reach the spiritual world   by renunciation. An ample and profound imagination, genial   sentiment, and pure humanity fill these poems – which are also   admirable in the sense of form – and make Heidenstam a manly poet   and a master of the lyric genre.\nA new aspect of Heidenstam’s development appeared in his   patriotic poetry. He had discovered early that love for the   ancestral hearth and for the home of one’s birth is what most   strongly links man to life. To this love he gave an intense   expression even in the poems of his youth; this love henceforth   linked him more closely to his country and to his people and   oriented his poetic genius toward the historic tales and memories   of Sweden. Compelled by such love, he summarized, in a cycle of   poems,\nEtt folk\n(1902) [\nOne People\n], all that is   Swedish into a unity with the same rights and obligations for   those who enter therein; and his love finally suggested a   patriotic dream of grandeur and called forth this passionate   demand: «No people may be greater than you; that is the   goal, no matter what the cost.» A whole series of great   prose-poems bears witness to his patriotism. In\nKarolinerna\n(1897-98) [\nThe Charles Men\n] he   describes, in the form of separate narratives, the inevitable   ruin of Swedish greatness through the act of Charles XII; with a   few quick strokes he sketches the tragic character of this   national hero and shows that in the end he was only the echo of   an ancient saga. In\nHeliga Birgittas pilgrimsfärd\n(1901) [\nSaint Bridget’s Pilgrimage\n] he gives a penetrating   explanation of this remarkable woman, suggesting that she quite   conscously sought sainthood but that she attained it   unconsciously when of her on will she divested herself of her   pride. Truly monumental are the two volumes of\nFolkunga   Trädet\n(1905-07) [\nThe Tree of the Folkungs\n],\nFolke Filbyter and Bjälboarvet\n[\nThe BjäIbo   Inheritance\n], which constitute the trunk and lower branches   of «the genealogical tree of the Folkungs», a great   historical prose epic in which he retraces the character of a   clan of chieftains and the destinies of the Swedes during a   period of the Middle Ages. Here the historical imagination of the   author, sustained by an inspiration forever fresh, follows all   threads in weaving the fates of his characters. His imagination,   with its symbolic visions, glistens before the eye.\nWhile Heidenstam was working on this epic about the life and   character of the Swedes, his cult for man was taking shape, and   one finds traces of it in the work. This cult often includes the   necessity to renew life through sacrifice and to aspire to a more   elevated earthly existence, an idea which is opposed to love and   the cult of woman and results logically in the exaltations of   stories\nSankt Göran och draken\n(1900) [St. George and   the Dragon] and\nSkogen susar\n(1904) [\nThe Forest   Whispers\n]. This collection contains, in particular, the great   prose-poem «Herakles».\nBeside these works, Heidenstam has published, among other things,   stories and memories of a trip,\nFrån Col di Tenda till   Blocksberg\n(1888) [From Col di Tenda to Blocksberg]; the   novel\nEndymion\n(1889), Oriental to the core; the book of   historical lectures\nSvenskarna och deras hövdingar\n(1908-10) [\nThe Swedes and Their Chieftains\n]; and the   collections\nTankar och teckningar\n(1899) [Thoughts and   Notes] and\nDagar och händelser\n(1909) [Days and   Occurrences]. In this last book he has notably treated subjects   of aesthetics and general culture.\nThe final aspect of Heidenstam’s concept of life is offered us   through his\nNya dikter\n(1915) [New Poems], a collection   mainly of philosophical poems of an elevated humanity, of a   mellow wisdom, of a beauty of images strangely serene. In   loneliness men come to understand themselves; love is the bond   which should unite them, and creative humility is the great force   which builds the world and which raises statues of the   gods.\n«O Man, you will become wise only when you reach the summit   of the evening-cool heights where all the earth is   beheld.»\nThe literary career of Verner von   Heidenstam (1859-1940) practically came to an end with the   publication of his\nNya dikter\n. His only work of importance   after this date was his idealized autobiography\nNär   kastanjerna blommade\n[When the Chestnuts Bloomed], which was   published posthumously in 1941. His collected works in 23 volumes   were published between 1943 and 1945.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nVerner von Heidenstam died on May 20, 1940.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Presentation.

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1919\nNobel Prize in Literature 1919\nCarl Spitteler\n- Carl Spitteler\nSwedish Academy\n, on December 10, 1920\n*\nThe Swedish Academy, in accordance with the   statutes of the Nobel Founcation, has awarded the Nobel Prize in   Literature for 1919, which was not awarded last year, to the   Swiss poet Carl Spitteler for his epic,\nOlympischer   Frühling\n(1906) [Olympian Spring].\nOf this work it can be truly said that its «significance has   become apparent only in recent years», and that all doubts   that prevented a full appreciation had to be carefully considered   until its merits, not immediately obvious, could be fully   recognized, not only as ornaments of the poetic form but above   all as the artistic and harmonious expressions of a superior   genius of rare independence and idealism.\nThis is not to say that we in any way subscribe to the opinion   that this poem represents the fruit of a persistent struggle with   the darkness of thought rather than of a lucid liberal   inspiration. The original gap between the poet’s art and its   appreciation by critics and readers does not in this case point   to a shortcoming on either side, but rather proves the deep and   rich meaning of the work, which needs careful critical judgment   to be revealed in its entirety.\nSpitteler’s\nOlympischer Frühling\nachieved popularity   in Switzerland and Germany only in the revised final version of   1909. But with every year and especially since the end of the   war, interest in it has grown and its circle of readers has   widened; this year’s impression is expected to run into several   thousand copies. That is a considerable number for something as   out of step with the times as a verse epic of 600 pages about the   gods of Olympus, which, because of its genre, must be read as a   whole and which demands the leisure and concentration of the   reader. The writer, who has for decades devoted all his energies   to such an enterprise, has indeed deliberately and ruthlessly   isolated himself from hectic contemporary life and has given   little thought to the modern demand for adequate material   compensation.\nHe has done nothing to soften these contrasts. On the contrary,   he has intentionally chosen a subject and an approach which were   bound to bewilder and even repel many readers of different   dispositions and inclinations or of different backgrounds of   taste and education, as they tried to understand the poetic world   that he opened before their eyes. From the beginning he was bold   enough to appeal to their patience and endurance to follow him to   the end of his curious paths, illuminated only by the clear and   uninterrupted thread of the action and the soliloquies and   dialogues of the heroes, which are highly dramatic despite the   epic framework. The connoisseur recognizes Homeric traits, but to   his surprise he is led on toward an unknown and never anticipated   goal.\nBut for the rest, what a harsh and striking contrast between   Homer’s Olympus and Spitteler’s idiosyncratic mythology! Nothing   could be more unjust than the reproach that he likes to attract   philologists and other disciples of scholarship by means of   recondite allusions and profound symbols borrowed from their   disciplines. His Olympians and heroes, his myths and oracles only   rarely remind one of the style or tone of the older Greek poet   philosophers. They can neither be derived from the latest   findings of classical scholarship nor cited as evidence of the   poet’s dependence on any kind of allegorical interpretation.   Equally misguided are those who have spoken of a third part of\nFaust\n. Spitteler does not imitate anyone, not even the   aging Goethe in his attempt to reconcile Romantic passion and   classical balance in the masks of Faust and Helen. Spitteler’s   mythology is a purely personal form of expression which grew   naturally out of his education and which gives shape to the   living turmoil of struggling characters that he evokes in order   to represent on the level of ideal imagination, human sufferings,   hopes, and disillusions, the vicissitudes of different human   fortunes in the struggle of the free will against imposed   necessity. Why should he care that the current aesthetic   enlightenment finds it difficult to accept this seemingly   fantastic mixture of dream and reality with its wilful abuse of   mythological names?\nEven if I attempted to give a careful and comprehensive summary   of the action of\nOlympischer Frühling\n, I could not   give a clear picture of the wealth of its content, of the radiant   vividness and moving power of the changing episodes, nor of their   firm interrelation in an effective whole. Suffice it to say that   the brilliant life of Olympus and the cosmos, manifesting itself   in pleasure and trials of strength, ends in impotent despair in   the face of human ingratitude, licence, crime, and misery.   Herakles, the mortal son of Zeus, equipped with all perfections   by his father, his relatives, and friends, but at the same time   burdened with the curse and hatred of Hera, the queen of the   gods, must leave Olympus to accomplish ungrateful tasks of pity   and courage on earth.\nThe Olympians, with their deeds and adventures, their victorious   fights and their quarrels among themselves are in reality   supermen whom the poet values only inasmuch as they are able to   curb their whims and desires.\n«Der Weise zügelt, der Tor lässt Willkür   walten.» Above them all there is an inexorable universal law   that assumes shape in gloomy powers of fate. Below them and   closer to us are the mechanizing, soulless powers of nature which   gods and men should put into their service for the benefit of   themselves and of others, but which, abused by malice and pride,   drive them into folly and ruin. The epic is full of airships and   other curious inventions and its gorgeous buildings with cupolas   and stately porches leave Homeric simplicity far behind. But the   plot of the impudent flatfoot people to deprive Apollo of his   universal rule by means of an artificial sun and their   overweening attempt to attack him in the air by means of a   treacherously constructed vehicle and poison gas testify to the   decay that threatens mankind when it pushes too far a   self-confidence based on material power.\nSpitteler describes such pranks and the strange quests and   enterprises of his heroes with a playful humour reminiscent of   Ariosto. His style has a great variety of tones and colors   ranging from solemn pathos to the careful brush strokes of the   similes and the lively descriptions of nature, which reflect his   native Alps rather than the regions of Greece. The iambic   hexameters with their alternating masculine and feminine rhymes   carry the flow of his masterly language, which is always powerful   and splendid, never without vitality, and often unmistakably   Swiss.\nThe Academy takes pleasure in expressing its admiration for the   independent culture of Spitteler’s poetry by awarding him this   Prize. Since Mr. Spitteler has been prevented by illness from   attending this ceremony, the Prize will be forwarded to him   through the Swiss Embassy.\nAt the banquet, Professor Oscar Montelius   addressed the Swiss Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Wrangel,   who received the Prize for Carl Spitteler, and asked him to   inform the poet of the Academy’s concern for his health and of   the hope that he would soon be able to write other works as   remarkable as\nOlympischer Frühling\n.\n* The Nobel Prize in Literature 1919 was   announced on November 11, 1920.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Through the originality of its plot and style, it   has aroused the liveliest interest in many countries and has   found favourable reception with the most diverse groups of   readers. Only recently a leading and distinctly conservative   English reviewer wrote that this book, which had appeared in   England only this year, was universally acclaimed as a   masterpiece. The reasons for this incontestable success will no   doubt hold the attention of literary critics for a long time, but   even now, under the impact of first impressions, they deserve to   be pointed out at least in their broad features.\nIn spite of current opinions of our time, those who want to find   in literature above all a faithful reproduction of reality, will   recognize in\nMarkens Grøde\nthe representation of a   life that forms the basis of existence and of the development of   societies wherever men live and build. These descriptions are not   distorted by any memories of a long, highly civilized past; their   immediate effect is due to the evocation of the harsh struggle   all active men must in the beginning endure (in varying external   conditions, of course) against an indomitable and rebellious   nature. It would be difficult to conceive of a more striking   contrast with works usually called «classic».\nNonetheless, this work may rightly be called classic, but in a   deeper and more profound sense than usual if this epithet is to   express something other and more than vague praise. The classic,   in the culture we have inherited from antiquity, is less the   perfect which calls for imitation than the significant which is   taken directly from life and which is rendered in a form of   enduring value even for future ages. The insignificant, that   which in itself is of no consequence, cannot be comprehended in   this notion any more than that which is formally provisional or   defective. But apart from that, whatever is precious in human   life, although it may appear common, can be placed in the same   category as the extraordinary and the brilliant, with a   significance and a form of equal value, once it is presented for   the first time in its proper light. In this sense it is no   exaggeration to maintain that in\nMarkens Grøde\nHamsun   has given to our times a classic that can be measured against the   best we already have. Antiquity does not possess in this respect   a monopoly inaccessible to future generations; for life is always   new and inexhaustible and as such can always be presented in new   forms created by new geniuses.\nHamsun’s work is an epic of labour to which the author has given   monumental lines. It is not a question of disparate labour which   divides men within and among themselves; it is a question of the   concentrated toil which in its purest form shapes men entirely,   which mollifies and brings together divided spirits, which   protects and increases their fruits with a regular and   uninterrupted progress. The labour of the pioneer and the first   farmer with all its difficulties, under the poet’s pen, thus   takes on the character of a heroic struggle that yields nothing   to the grandeur of the manly sacrifice for one’s country and   companions in arms. Just as the peasant poet Hesiod described the   labours of the field, so Hamsun has put in the foreground of his   work the ideal labourer who dedicates his whole life and all his   powers to clearing the land and to triumphing over the obstacles   with which men and the forces of nature confront him. If Hamsun   has cast behind him all the weighty memories of civilization, he   has by his own work contributed to a precise understanding of the   new culture that our era expects to arise from the progress of   physical labour as a continuation of ancient civilization.\nHamsun does not present so-called types on his stage. His heroes   and heroines are all very much alive, all in quite modest   circumstances. Certain among them, and the best, are   unimaginative in their goals and thoughts, the principal example   being the tireless and silent farmer himself. Others are   drifting, troubled, and often even bewildered by egoistic   aspirations and follies. They all carry the mark of their   Norwegian origin; they are all conditioned in some manner by   «the fruits of the earth». It is one of the   characteristics of our sister languages that often the same words   express very different nuances of meaning by the images they   evoke. When we Swedes speak of the «fruits of the   earth», we think immediately of something fertile, abundant,   succulent, preferably in an agricultural region that has been   cultivated for a long time. The thought of Hamsun’s book is not   oriented in this direction. «The earth» here is the   rugged and forbidding fallow soil. Its fruits do not fall from a   cornucopia of abundance; they comprise all that can germinate and   grow in this ungrateful soil, the good and the bad, the beautiful   and the ugly, among men and animals as well as in the forest and   the fields. Such are the kinds of fruits Hamsun’s work offers for   our harvest.\nHowever, we Swedes, or at least many Swedes, do not feel strange   in the regions and circumstances described to us here. We   rediscover the atmosphere of the North with all that is a part of   its natural and social milieu, and with many parallels on both   sides of the frontier. Moreover, Hamsun also presents Swedish   characters who are drawn to the newly cultivated land, most of   them no doubt attracted by the mirage of brilliant economic   success, as the cities on the Norwegian coasts appear on the   horizon like snares of the great worldly life enticing   defenceless hearts from the heavy toil of the land.\nThese and other quite human projections, far from weakening,   reinforce the impression produced by the classic content of the   story. They dissipate the apprehension one could feel in seeing   the light of the ideal at the expense of truth; they guarantee   the sincerity of the design, the truth of the images and the   characters. Their common humanity escapes no one. The proof is in   the welcome this work has found among peoples of different   mentalities, languages, and customs. Furthermore, through the   light touch of smiling humour with which the author treats even   the saddest things he relates, he has proved his own compassion   for human destiny and human nature. But in the story, he never   departs from the most complete artistic serenity. The style,   stripped of vain ornaments, renders the reality of things with   certainty and clarity, and one rediscovers in it, under a   personal and powerful form, all the richness of nuance of the   writer’s mother tongue.\nMr. Knut Hamsun – In facing the rigours of the season as well as   the fatigues of a long trip particularly arduous at this time in   order to come to receive the Prize awarded you, you have given   great joy to the Swedish Academy, which will certainly be shared   by all the persons present at this ceremony. In the name of the   Academy, I have tried as well as possible in the short time   accorded me to express at least some of the major reasons for   which we appreciate so highly your work which has just been   crowned. Thus, in addressing myself now to you personally, I do   not wish to repeat what I have said. It remains for me only to   congratulate you in the name of the Academy and to express the   hope that the memories you will keep of your visit with us will   be ties that will link you to us also in the future.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Karlfeldt\n,   Permanent Secretary of the\nSwedish   Academy\n, on December 10, 1921\nAnatole France was no longer a young man   when, in 1881, he captured the attention of the literary public   in France and subsequently in the civilized world with his   curious novel,\nLe Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard\n. He had   behind him a long stretch of years during which his development   had been carried on without attracting wide attention. But if,   during this period of slow growth, his literary efforts had been   infrequent and not very energetic, the work to which he had   subjected his intellect, his thought, and his taste had been   proportionately wider and more vigorous. No immoderate desire for   fame moved him. Ambition seems to have played a small role in his   life. Indeed, he tells the story that at the age of seven he   wanted to be famous. Excited by the legends of saints told to him   by his good, pious mother, he wanted to settle in the desert and   as a hermit match the glory of St. Anthony and St. Jerome. His   desert was the\nJardin des Plantes\nwhere the huge beasts   lived in houses and cages, and where God the Father seemed to him   to raise his arms to heaven blessing the antelope, the gazelle,   and the dove. His mother was frightened by such vanity but her   husband soothed her: «My dear, you will see that at twenty   he will be disgusted with fame.» «My father was not   mistaken», France says. «Like the King of Yvetot, I   lived quite well without fame and no longer had the least desire   to engrave my name on the memory of men. As for the dream of   becoming a hermit, I refashioned it every time I believed I felt   life was thoroughly bad; in other words, I refashioned it every   day. But every day nature took me by the ear and led me to the   amusements in which our humble lives pass away.» At the age   of fifteen the young Anatole France dedicated his first essay,   «La Légende de Sainte Radegonde, Reine de France»,   to his father and his beloved mother. This work is now lost, but   even much later, when his faith in saints had vanished, he was   still able to write legends with a pen dipped in the gold of   haloes.\nThe poet’s star seems to have been illuminated first in that   bright constellation bearing the name Anatole France. In the old   library of his worthy father, he soon felt a thirst for   knowledge, amidst the noble dust of old books. Into this shop,   whose proud sign «Aux Armes de France» inspired father   and son to take up the literary name, came collectors and   bibliophiles to examine the recently acquired treasures and to   discuss authors and editions. Thus the young Anatole, always a   good listener, was initiated into the mysteries of erudition, a   pursuit he considered the highest pleasure of a peaceful life. We   need only look at the Abbé Coignard, all beaming as he   leaves the grill room of the «Reine Pédauque»   where he pays for the material pleasures of this world by giving   some lessons to a young spit-turner and by dispensing the   treasures of an eloquence full of wisdom, irony, and Christian   faith; we see him turn toward the library to feast his spirit   free of charge on the latest books arrived from Holland, the   country of classical editions. And, bored with domestic tedium,   here is Mr. Bergeret, who comes to pass the finest hours of his   day in conversation with friends gathered around the library’s   display shelves. Anatole France is the poet of libraries and   bookworms. His imagination revels in the visions of bibliophiles,   as when he praises that marvellous\nAstaracienne\n, a giant   collection of books and manuscripts in which a noble cabalist   sought proofs to bolster his superstition. «More fervently   than ever», says Coignard toward the end of his adventurous   career, «I want to sit down behind a table, in some   venerable gallery, where many choice books would be assembled in   silence. I prefer their conversation to that of men. I have found   diverse ways of life and I judge that the best way is to devote   oneself to study, to support calmly one’s part in the   vicissitudes of life, and to prolong, by the spectacle of   centuries and of empires, the brevity of our days.» Love of   intellectual work is a fundamental characteristic of Anatole   France’s personal religion and just like his Abbé, he   prefers, from the height of the ivory tower of knowledge and   thought, to turn his gaze toward far-off times and countries. His   irony lives in the present, his devotion in the past.\nYet though our existence is fragile, beauty lives everywhere, and   for the writer it materializes in form and style. Anatole   France’s vast studies and great meditation have bestowed a rare   solidity on his work, but no less serious is the labour he has   devoted to the perfecting of his style. The language which he had   to shape is one of the noblest; French is the most richly endowed   daughter of the mother tongue Latin. It has served the greatest   masters. Now grave, now merry, it possesses serenity and charm,   strength and melody. In many places France calls it the most   beautiful language on earth and lavishes the most tender epithets   on it as to a beloved woman. But as a true son of the ancients,   he wishes it\nsimplex munditiis\n. He is an artist, certainly   one of the greatest, but his art aspires to keep his language,   through severe purification, as simple and, at the same time, as   expressive as possible. In contemporary Europe, where flourishes   a superficial dilettantism, dangerous for the purity of   languages, his work is a richly instructive example of what art   can do with true resources. His language is the classical French,   the French of Fénélon and Voltaire, and rather than   contribute new ornaments to it, he gives it a slightly archaic   stamp which admirably suits his subjects, often taken from   antiquity. His French is so transparent that one would like to   apply to it what he said of Leila, daughter of Lilith, one of the   luminous and fragile beings sprung from his imagination: «If   crystal could speak, it would speak in this fashion.»\nLet us recall now, for our own pleasure, some of the works which   have secured for the name of Anatole France the world-wide renown   which he has so little desired but which nevertheless he cannot   avoid. By so doing we will often encounter France himself, for he   is less inclined than most writers to hide behind his characters   and words.\nHe is recognized as a master of the tale, which he has made a   wholly personal genre, in which erudition, imagination, serene   charm of style, and depth of irony and passion combine to produce   marvellous effects. Who can ever forget his Balthazar? The Negro   King of Ethiopia comes to pay a visit to Balkis, the beautiful   Queen of Sheba, and soon wins her love. But shortly the fickle   queen forgets him to give herself to another. Wounded to death   physically and emotionally, Balthazar returns to his country to   devote himself to the highest wisdom of the seers, astrology.   Suddenly an astonishing and sublime light spreads over the   intense gloom of his passion. Balthazar discovers a new star and,   high in the heavenly concourse, the star speaks to him, and in   the light it sheds he joins with two neighbouring kings. No   longer can Balkis hold him. His soul is detached from   voluptuousness and he undertakes the pursuit of the star. The   star which spoke was no other than the star which led the Three   Wise Men to the manger at Jerusalem.\nAnother time France opens before our eyes a mother-of-pearl   casket filled with priceless jewels, chased by the hand of a   master of antiquity. We find in it the legend, slightly ironic   but most seductive, of Célestin and d’Amyers, of the old   hermit and the young faun singing together the Easter Alleluia,   the one exalting in the return of Christ and the other in the   return of the sun, worshippers communing in a single innocent   piety, reunited at last – under the alarmed eye of the historian   – in a single sacred tomb. This story shows us France in a realm   in which he delights, the realm between paganism and   Christianity, where twilight and dawn are mingled, where satyrs   meet with apostles, where sacred and profane animals wander,   where ample materials are found to exercise his fantasy, his   contemplation, and his spiritual irony in all its nuances. One   often does not know whether to call it fiction or reality.\nRomantic chastity is celebrated in the legends of the saints   Oliverie and Liberette, Euphrosine and Scolastica. These are   pages taken from the chronicles of saints, literary pastiches   perhaps, executed with talent and a sense for the   miraculous.\nStill another time France takes us to the pits outside of Sienna   where, in the spring twilight, a sweet barefooted Carmelite   narrates the story of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Claire, the   daughter of his soul, and that of the holy satyr who served   masters as different as Jupiter, Saturn, and the Galilean, a   profound if hardly edifying legend, but recounted by France in   the most exquisite style.\nIn his famous novel Thaïs (1890) he enthusiastically   penetrates the Alexandrine world at the time when the scourging   thorns of Christianity were ravaging among the last effeminate   survivors of Hellenic civilization. Asceticism and voluptuousness   are at their heights here, mysteries and aesthetic orgies flower   side by side, angels and demons incarnate press around the   Fathers of the Church and the neo-Hellenic philosophers,   disputing over human souls. The story is steeped in the moral   nihilism of that era, but it includes beautiful passages such as   the magnificent descriptions of the desert solitude in which the   anchorites preach from atop their columns or are subject to   nightmares in the mummies’ tombs.\nHowever, one must put\nLa Rôtisserie de la Reine   Pédauque\n(1893) [\nAt the Sign of the Reine   Pédauque\n] in the first rank of Anatole France’s novels.   There he has sketched a group of true-to-life characters,   legitimate or natural offspring of his mind in their own   colourful world. The Abbé Coignard is so alive that one can   study him as a real character who reveals all his complexity only   when one has penetrated his privacy. Perhaps others have had the   same experience I had. At first I had but little sympathy for   this clumsy, loquacious priest and doctor of theology, who has so   little concern for his dignity that sometimes he even steals or   commits other equally heinous crimes, which he nevertheless   defends with shameless casuistry. But he improves on better   acquaintance, and I have learned to love him. He is not only a   brilliant sophist, but an infinitely amusing character who   exercises his irony not only on others but also on himself. There   is profound humour in the contrast between his lofty views and   his shabby life, and one must regard him with the smiling   tolerance of his creator. Coignard is one of the most remarkable   figures in contemporary literature. He is a new and vigorous   plant in the Rabelaisian vineyard.\nA type at once grotesque and lovable is the cabalist of Astarac.   The crude mystic evidently must be included in a novel dealing   with eighteenth-century manners. But the beings this magician   evokes are of a singularly ethereal species; freed of earthly   bonds, he enjoys the sweet and useful society of salamanders and   sylphs. As proof of the talents of these beings, d’Astarac tells   how once a sylph obliged a French scholar by arranging delivery   of a message to Descartes, who was then living in Stockholm where   he was teaching philosophy to Queen Christine. Sworn enemy of   superstition that he may be, Anatole France should be grateful to   that superstition for all the happy suggestions it has given him   for his work.\nAdmirably rendered is the accent of pious simplicity with which   the Abbé’s student, the young spit-turner, recounts all   these turbulent events. When his master, revered despite   everything, after having suffered to his last moments the assault   of the powers of darkness, finally dies a holy death in a Church   he had never ceased to recognize openly, the student traces in   Latin an ingenuous epithet praising the Abbé’s wisdom and   virtues. The author himself, in a later work, delivers an   obituary eulogy for his principal hero. Presenting him as a blend   of an Epicurean with a St. Francis, one who scorned men tenderly,   France speaks of his benevolent irony and his merciful   scepticism. Aside from the religious aspect, this   characterization applies equally well to Anatole France   himself\nLet us accompany him then without fear in his philosophical   strolls in the garden of Epicurus. He will teach us humility. He   will say to us: the world is infinitely large and man is   infinitely small. What do you imagine? Our ideals are luminous   shades but it is in following them that we find our only true   happiness. He will say that human mediocrity is widespread, but   he will not exclude himself from it. We may reproach him for the   sensuality that occupies too large a place in some of his works   and for the hedonistic sentiments, for example, which he   describes under the sign of the red lily of Florence, and which   are not made for serious minds. He will reply, according to the   maxims of his spiritual father, that the pleasures of the mind   surpass by far those of the flesh, and the serene calm of the   soul is the port into which the wise man steers his boat in order   to escape the tempests of sensual life. We shall hear him express   the wish that time, which deprives us of so many things, may   allow us compassion for our fellow man, so that in our old age we   do not find ourselves shut up as in a tomb.\nFollowing this inclination Anatole France left his aesthetic   seclusion, his «ivory tower», to throw himself into the   social fray of his time, to clamour like Voltaire for the   restoration of the rights of persons unjustly condemned as well   as of his own wounded patriotism; and he has gone into the   workers’ quarters to look for means of reconciling classes and   nations. His old age has not become a walled tomb. The end has   been good for him. After having been accorded many sunny years at   the court of the Graces, he still throws the glint of gay   learning into the idealistic struggle that, at an advanced age,   he wages against the decadence of societies and against   materialism and the power of money. His activity in this regard   does not interest us directly, but we obtain from it the   inestimable advantage of being able to fix his literary image   against the background of a lofty nobility of sentiments. There   is nothing of the careerist about him. His much discussed work on   Joan of Arc, which has cost him enormous toil and which was   intended to tear the veil of mysticism from the inspired heroine   of France and to restore her to nature, to real life, was a   thankless enterprise in an era prepared to canonize her.\n«The Gods are Athirst!» The great drama of the   Revolution unfolds and, as with the battle of ideas, the trivial   destinies of men are reflected in blood. Do not believe, however,   that France would wish to present this squaring of accounts as   being definitive. A century is far too short a period of time to   permit delineating distinctly the march of men toward more   tolerance and humanity. How have events fulfilled his   predictions! Several years after the appearance of this book the   great catastrophe occurred. What beautiful arenas have been   prepared now for the games of salamanders! The smoke of battles   still hangs over the earth. And out of the fog surge gnomes,   sinister spirits of the earth. Are these the dead who return?   Sombre prophets announce a new revelation. A wave of superstition   threatens to flood the ruins of civilization. Anatole France   wields the subtle and corrosive weapon which puts to flight the   ghosts and the false saints. For our times, faith is infinitely   necessary – but a faith purified by healthy doubts, by the spirit   of clarity, a new humanism, a new Renaissance, a new   Reformation.\nSweden cannot forget the debt which, like the rest of the   civilized world, she owes to French civilization. Formerly we   received in abundance the gifts of French Classicism like the   ripe and delicate fruits of antiquity. Without them, where would   we be? This is what we must ask ourselves today. In our time   Anatole France has been the most authoritative representative of   that civilization; he is the last of the great classicists. He   has even been called the last European. And indeed, in an era in   which chauvinism, the most criminal and stupid of ideologies,   wants to use the ruins of the great destruction for the building   of new walls to prevent free intellectual exchange between   peoples, his clear and beautiful voice is raised higher than that   of others, exhorting people to understand that they need one   another. Witty, brilliant, generous, this knight without fear is   the best champion in the sublime and incessant war which   civilization has declared against barbarism. He is a marshal of   the France of the glorious era in which Corneille and Racine   created their heroes.\nToday, as we in our old Germanic country award the world prize of   the poets to this Gallic master, the faithful servant of truth   and beauty, the heir of humanism, of the lineage of Rabelais,   Montaigne, Voltaire, Renan, we think of the words he once spoke   at the foot of Renan’s statue – his profession of faith is   complete in them: «Slowly but surely humanity realizes wise   men’s dreams.»\nMr. Anatole France – You have inherited that admirable tool, the   French language, the language of a noble and classical nation,   which is reverently guarded by the famous academy you adorn and   is maintained by it in an enviable condition of purity. You have   that brilliant tool of piercing sharpness, and in your hand it   acquires a scintillating beauty. You have used it masterfully to   cut out\nchefs-d’oeuvre\nvery French in their style and   refinement. But it is not your art alone that charms us: we   revere your creative genius as well, and we have been enticed by   the generous, compassionate heart which so many exalted pages of   your works reveal.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

He made his debut as a poet in 1893 with Cartas de Mujeres (Women’s Letters), and most of his 172 published works are plays. Benavente’s convictions as a monarchist caused him, despite some doubts, to support Spanish dictator Franco’s regime.",

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1922\nNobel Prize in Literature 1922\nJacinto Benavente\n- Jacinto Benavente\nSwedish Academy\n, on December 10, 1922\nJacinto Benavente has devoted his   imaginative gifts mainly to the theatre, and it seems as if he   has systematically guided the course of his development in this   direction through many varieties of experience. But with this   imaginative artist, system seems to be a free and direct   expression of his whole being. It appears that no one could have   reached his goal with less effort and brooding in comparison with   the value of the achievement.\nThe feeling which has carried him on has also been of an   unusually complete and harmonious nature: it is not only the   dramatic art and the atmosphere of the theatre that he has loved;   he has cherished an equally warm affection for life outside, for   the world of realities which it was his task to bring to the   stage. It is not a matter of mere uncritical and superficial   worship of life. He has observed his world with extremely clear   and keen eyes, and what he has seen he has measured and weighed   with an alert and flexible intelligence. He has not allowed   himself to be duped either by men or by ideas, not even by his   own ideas or his own pathos. Nevertheless, he does not strike one   as being in the least bitter, or even blasé.\nHis writing has thus obtained its most distinctive quality –   grace. This is such a rare value, especially in our own times,   that there is little demand for it on the market and it is not   recognized by most people. Grace, however, is as precious as it   is uncommon. It is the token of the balance of powers, of the   self-discipline and assurance of art, especially when it is not   an end in itself and a mere frivolity, but when, without apparent   effort, it stamps its mark on the entire form-giving process. It   does not, then, merely play on the surface, affecting the style;   it also determines each proportion in the treatment of the   subject and every line in its depiction.\nThis is precisely the case with Benavente. The effect he attains   may vary greatly in strength, but it is based on unfailing tact   and strict loyalty to the subject. He gives what the subject is   able to give without effort and without bombast. The fare he   provides may be more or less rich and interesting, but it is   always unadulterated. This is a classic feature in   Benavente.\nNevertheless, his bent is above all realistic, if we eliminate   from that label all the customary flavour of social tendency,   commonplace philosophy, or gross striving for effect. To   reproduce the wealth and mobility of life, the play of   characters, and the struggle between wills, in a way that comes   as near truth as possible – that is his chief aim. When he aims   at something beyond this – to stimulate thought, to solve   problems, to demolish prejudices, to enlarge human sympathy – he   does so with the most scrupulous care not to tamper with the   objective accuracy of the literary description. He exercises this   unusual discipline even when he is faced with the strongest   temptation for a dramatist – dramatic and scenic effect. However   easily a scene could be made more telling by increasing the   tension of the conflict and plot, by putting on more flaring   colours, by flogging up the emotions to their highest pitch,   Benavente never does this at the expense of truth: he permits no   blurring of the tone. He is a rare example of a born dramatist,   one whose imagination, by itself, creates in accordance with the   laws of the stage, but yet avoids anything theatrical as fully as   all other false conventions.\nHis activity lies especially in comedy, but that term in Spanish   is more inclusive than with us; it comprises what we may in   general call middleclass plays without tragic conclusions. If   there is such a conclusion, the pieces are called dramas, and   Benavente has also written such plays, including the remarkable   and moving play,\nLa Malquerida\n(1913) [The Wrongly Loved].   He has also composed many romantic and fantastic pieces, among   which are exquisite achievements of poetic art, especially on a   small scale.\nBut his central significance lies in his comedies, which, as we   have seen, may well be as serious as they are gay; and in the   short forms of comedy, which in Spanish literature have been   developed into special species with old and glorious traditions.   In the latter Benavente is an enchanting master because of his   unlaboured wit and comic verve, his radiant good nature, and his   grace, which combines all these qualities. I have time for only a   few names:\nDe pequeñas causas\n(1908) [For Small   Reasons];\nEl amor asusta\n(1907) [Love Frightens];\nNo   fumadores\n(1904) [Smoking Prohibited]. But there are many   others, an entire treasury of merry jest, where the battle is   waged so lightly and so elegantly that it is always   good-tempered, however sharp the weapon itself may be.\nIn the larger works we encounter an amazing range of spheres of   life and subject matter. They are taken from peasant life, from   all circles of society in the town, from the artist’s world down   to the travelling circus people whom the poet embraces with a   strong human sympathy and whom he values more highly than many   other classes.\nBut it is mainly the life of the upper classes that he has   treated in its two characteristic centres, Madrid and Moraleda,   the latter a place not found on the map, but which in its sunny   and alluring variety comprises the typical features of a   provincial town in Castile. In La farándula (1897) [The   Company of Comedians] the ambitious politician goes to this town   in order to rally and to gain the support of the uncorrupted   energies of the people for a somewhat vaguely defined ideal; in   the play\nLa Gobernadora\n(1901) [The Governor’s Wife],   conceited ambition dreams of a larger stage for its greater   talents. Moraleda is really a planetary world, which is attracted   and illuminated by Madrid and does not reveal the full force of   its comedy except in comparison with Madrid.\nThe capital and its spiritual content are made understandable   much more fully through personal vicissitudes of fortune which   are determined, as are its fashions and its culture, by the   strata of its society. We see a distinct development in the art   of Benavente. He begins by stressing the description of   environment, with an abundant wealth of colour and life and   features that reveal character. The dramatic element proper –   unsought, like all the rest of the apparatus – exists for the   most part merely to keep the action going. Its function is to   arrange the whirl of life in a picture, composed in groups, with   strong individual scenes. He has taken pains to create a faithful   and artistic mirror of reality, which is then left to speak for   itself.\nLater his composition becomes more rigid. Although it is arranged   firmly around a stronger, deeper, and more spiritual dramatic   conflict, it is, nevertheless, almost as simple as when Benavente   was merely writing episodes describing society. There is nothing   artificial, nothing abstract and isolated, in the human fates   which are represented. As before, they are still connected with   the world around them, but the light is strictly limited,   revealing only what is central from a dramatic point of view. The   sharp characterization is carried just far enough to make the   action clear; the psychology is merely a means, not an end.   Nothing is laboriously prepared beforehand; nothing strikes one   really as being prepared at all: every feature in the action   comes, as it were, with the improvisation of life and may take   one by surprise until one has reflected for a moment, just as   happens in life itself. The technique, too, is purely realistic   and has not searched for models in ancient tragedy. Summing up   the past is not the main function of this kind of drama, nor is   the dialogue a kind of cross-examination to discover the past.   The required discoveries are made by life itself by means of the   unforced course of the action.\nBroadly speaking, Benavente does not seek to harrow the   spectator; his object is a solution of conflicts that is   harmonious even in melancholy and sorrow. This harmony is usually   gained by resignation, not weary or aloof or pathetic, and   without great gestures. The characters suffer, tear at their   bonds, are attracted by fortune (the way to which is to pass over   others’ fortune), wrestle in conflicts, measure their world and   themselves, and gain a clearer and wider vision through their   constraint. hat which has the last word is not passion, in fact   not the ego at all, but the spiritual value that proves so great   that, were it lost, the ego would be poor and fortune empty. The   decision is made without capitulation, merely through the fact   that the personality is face to face with the consequences of its   choice of fate and chooses freely, on the basis of instinctive   feeling rather than in accordance with theories.\nI have time for only one or two titles of his strange, simple,   and quiet dramas:\nAlma triumfante\n(1902) [Conquering   Soul],\nLa propria estimacion\n(1915) [Self-respect], and\nCampo de armiño\n(1916) [The White Scutcheon]. There   are many others of equal value which are more or less like these.   he distinctive mark of them all is a peculiarly pure humanity,   which at first glance is surprising in the keen and flashing   satirist, while the moderation and the freedom from all   sentimentality in the mode of expression are in complete   accordance with his schooling. As a matter of fact his qualities   go well together: as his grace of form is a classic feature, so   are his feeling and his insight classic, strictly schooled, well   balanced, farsighted, and clear. His simplicity of expression and   hushed tone come from the same source.\nNevertheless, Teutonic readers are often reminded, even when it   comes to an art as good as this, that it has sprung from a   national temperament other than ours and from other poetic   traditions. The kind of lyric we desire, at least in the   atmosphere of the world of drama, is on the whole probably   unknown to the Romance nations. Half-light, both in nature and in   the human soul, is lacking in them: all that human beings contain   is expressed, or it seems that it\ncan\nbe expressed. Their   thoughts may have brilliance, rapidity, and, of course, clarity;   but they strike us as lacking in power, as belonging to a   somewhat more vacant atmosphere, and as having less life in their   inner being. What southerners say of our art may reveal equally   great defects; but we must mutually accustom ourselves to admire   what we understand and to leave outside our aesthetic judgments   things which, for the reasons mentioned, fail to satisfy   us.\nIn the works in which the Spaniard Benavente has abandoned his   comedy descriptive of society and individuals, and instead has   ranged over larger complexes of ideas and has sought to interpret   all the unrest and yearning of our times, we cannot follow him   with the admiration that has been bestowed upon trim by his   countrymen. This is true of\nEl collar de estrellas\n(1915)   [The Belt of Stars] and several other pieces.\nI have not dwelt on the limitations of his art, but sought to   indicate the central qualities of his craftsmanship in his   country and in his time. I believe that scarcely any other   contemporary dramatist has anywhere captured the life about him   in such a many-sided and faithful manner and given it a form so   immediate and, through its simple and noble art, so durable. The   traditions of Spanish poetry comprise a strong, bold, and sound   realism, a prolific power of growth, and an inimitable charm in   the comic spirit which is merry and built on realities, not on   conversational wit. Benavente has shown that he belongs to this   school and, in a form peculiar to himself, has worked out a   modern comedy of character containing much of the classic spirit.   He has proved himself to be a worthy adherent of an ancient and   elevated style of poetry; and that is to say a great deal.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1923\nNobel Prize in Literature 1923\nWilliam Butler Yeats\n- William Butler Yeats\nSwedish Academy\n, on December 10, 1923\nVery early, in the first bloom of youth,   William Butler Yeats emerged as a poet with an indisputable right   to the name; his autobiography shows that the inner promptings of   the poet determined his relations to the world even when he was a   mere boy. He has developed organically in the direction indicated   by his emotional and intellectual life from the very   beginning.\nHe was born in an artistic home – in Dublin – thus beauty   naturally became a vital necessity for him. He showed artistic   powers, and his education was devoted to the satisfying of this   tendency; little effort was made to secure traditional schooling.   He was educated for the most part in England, his second   fatherland; nonetheless his decisive development was linked to   Ireland, chiefly to the comparatively unspoiled Celtic district   of Connaught where his family had their summer home. There he   inhaled the imaginative mysticism of popular belief and popular   stories which is the most distinctive feature of his people, and   amidst a primitive nature of mountain and sea he became absorbed   in a passionate endeavour to capture its very soul.\nThe soul of nature was to him no empty phrase, for Celtic   pantheism, the belief in the existence of living, personal powers   behind the world of phenomena, which most of the people had   retained, seized hold of Yeats’s imagination and fed his innate   and strong religious needs. When he came nearest to the   scientific spirit of his time, in zealous observations of the   life of nature, he characteristically concentrated on the   sequence of various bird notes at daybreak and the flight of   moths as the stars of twilight were kindled. The boy got so far   in his intimacy with the rhythm of the solar day that he could   determine the time quite exactly by such natural signs. From this   intimate communion with the sounds of morning and nighttime, his   poetry later received many of its most captivating traits.\nHe abandoned his training in the fine arts soon after he had   grown up in order to devote himself to poetry, for which his   inclination was strongest. But this training is evident   throughout his whole career, both in the intensity with which he   worships form and personal style and, still more, in the   paradoxically audacious solution of problems in which his acute   but fragmentary philosophical speculation sought its way to what   he needed for his own peculiar nature.\nThe literary world he entered, when he settled down in London at   the end of the eighties, did not offer him much positively, but   it at least offered him fellowship in opposition, which to   pugnacious youth seems particularly dear. It was filled with   weariness and rebellion toward the spirit of the times which had   prevailed just before, namely that of dogmatic natural science   and naturalistic art. There were few whose hostility was so   deeply grounded as that of Yeats, altogether intuitive,   visionary, and indomitably spiritualistic as he was.\nHe was disturbed not only by the cocksureness of natural science   and the narrowness of reality-aping art; even more, he was   horrified by the dissolution of personality and the frigidity   which issued from scepticism, by the desiccation of imagination   and emotional life in a world which at best had faith only in a   collective and automatic progression to the sacred land of   Cockaigne. Events proved him to be terribly right: the   «paradise» which could be reached by humanity with such   schooling, we have now the dubious advantage of enjoying.\nEven more beautiful kinds of social utopianism, represented by   the greatly admired poet William Morris, did not captivate such   an individualist as young Yeats. Later he found his way to the   people, and then not as an abstract conception, but as the Irish   people, to whom he had been close as a child. What he sought in   that people was not the masses stirred by present day demands,   but an historically developed soul which he wished to arouse to   more conscious life.\nIn the intellectual unrest of London, things nationally Irish   remained dear to Yeats’s heart; this feeling was nurtured by   summer visits to his homeland and by comprehensive studies of its   folklore and customs. His earlier lyrics are almost exclusively   built on his impressions from these. His early poems immediately   won high esteem in England because the new material, with its   strong appeal to the imagination, received a form which, despite   its special characteristics, was nevertheless linked closely with   several of the noblest traditions of English poetry. The blending   together of Celtic and English, which had never been successfully   effected in the political sphere, became a reality here in the   world of poetic imagination – a symptom of no small spiritual   significance.\nHowever much Yeats had read of English masters, his verse has a   new character. The cadence and the colours have changed, as if   they had been moved to another air – that of the Celtic twilight   by the sea. There is a greater element of song than is usual in   modern English poetry. The music is more melancholy, and, under   the gentle rhythm, which for all its freedom moves as securely as   a sleepwalker, we have a hint of yet another rhythm with the slow   breathing of the wind and the eternal pulse of the powers of   nature. When this art reaches its highest level it is absolutely   magical, but it is seldom easy to grasp. It is indeed often so   obscure that an effort is needed to understand it. This obscurity   lies partly in the mysticism of the actual subject, but perhaps   just as much in the Celtic temperament, which seems to be more   distinguished by fire, delicacy, and penetration than by   clearness. But no small part may have been played by the   tendencies of the time: symbolism and\nl’art pour l’art\n,   chiefly absorbed by the task of finding the boldly appropriate   word.\nYeats’s association with the life of a people saved him from the   barrenness which attended so much of the effort for beauty that   marked his age. Around him as the central point and leader arose,   within a group of his countrymen in the literary world of London,   that mighty movement which has been named the Celtic Revival and   which created a new national literature, an Anglo-Irish   literature.\nThe foremost and most versatile poet of this group was Yeats. His   rousing and rallying personality caused the movement to grow and   flower very quickly, by giving a common aim to hitherto scattered   forces or by encouraging new forces previously unconscious of   their existence.\nThen, too, the Irish Theatre came into existence. Yeats’s active   propaganda created both a stage and a public, and the first   performance was given with his drama\nThe Countess Cathleen\n(1892). This work, extraordinarily rich in poetry was followed by   a series of poetic dramas. all on Irish subjects drawn mainly   from the old heroic sagas. The most beautiful among these are\nDeirdre\n(1907), the fateful tragedy of the Irish Helen;\nThe Green Helmet\n(1910), a merrily heroic myth of a   peculiarly primitive wildness; and above all\nThe King’s   Threshold\n(1904), where the simple material has been   permeated by thought of a rare grandeur and depth. The quarrel   about the place and rank of the bard at the king’s court here   gives rise to the ever-burning question as to how much spiritual   things are to hold good in our world, and whether they are to be   received with true or false faith. With the claims on which the   hero stakes his life, he defends in the supremacy of poetry all   that makes the life of man beautiful and worthy. It would not   become all poets to put forward such claims, but Yeats could do   so: his idealism has never been dulled, nor has the severity of   his art. In these dramatic pieces his verse attains a rare beauty   and sureness of style.\nMost enchanting, however, is his art in\nThe Land of Heart’s   Desire\n(1894), which has all the magic of fairy poetry and   all the freshness of spring, in its clear but as it were dreamy   melody. Dramatically, also, this work is one of his finest; and   it might be called the flower of his poetry, had he not also   written the little prose drama\nCathleen ni Hoolihan\n(1902), which is at once his simplest folk play and his most   classically perfect work.\nHere more powerfully than anywhere else he touches the patriotic   string. The subject is Ireland’s struggle for liberty throughout   the ages, and the chief personage is Ireland herself,   impersonated by a wandering beggar woman. But we hear no simple   tone of hatred, and the profound pathos of the piece is more   restrained than in any other comparable poem. We hear only the   purest and highest part of the nation’s feeling; the words are   few and the action the simplest possible. The whole thing is   greatness without a touch of affectation. The subject, having   come to Yeats in a dream, has retained its visionary stamp of   being a gift from above-a conception not foreign to Yeats’s   aesthetic philosophy.\nMuch more might be said of Yeats’s work, but it must suffice to   mention the ways followed by his dramas of recent years. They   have often been romantic by virtue of their strange and uncommon   material, but they have generally striven after classic   simplicity of form. This classicism has been gradually developed   into bold archaism; the poet has sought to attain the primitive   plasticity found in the beginning of all dramatic art. He has   devoted much intensive, acute thought to the task of emancipating   himself from the modern stage, with its scenery that disturbs the   picture called up by the imagination, with its plays whose   features are necessarily exaggerated by the footlights, with its   audience’s demand for realistic illusion. Yeats wishes to bring   out the poem as it was born in the poet’s vision; he has given   form to this vision following Greek and Japanese models. Thus he   has revived the use of masks and has found a great place for the   actors’ gestures to the accompaniment of simple music.\nIn the pieces thus simplified and brought to a strict stylistic   unity, whose subjects are still taken by preference from the hero   legends of Ireland, he has sometimes attained a fascinating   effect, even for the mere reader, both in the highly compressed   dialogue and in the choruses with their deep lyrical tone. All   this, however, is in its period of growth, and it is not yet   possible to decide whether the sacrifices made are fully   compensated for by what has been gained. These pieces, though in   themselves highly noteworthy, will probably find greater   difficulty in becoming popular than the earlier ones.\nIn these plays as well as in his clearest and most beautiful   lyrics, Yeats has achieved what few poets have been able to do:   he has succeeded in preserving contact with his people while   upholding the most aristocratic artistry. His poetical work has   arisen in an exclusively artistic milieu which has had many   perils; but without abjuring the articles of his aesthetic faith,   his burning and questing personality, ever aiming at the ideal,   has contrived to keep itself free from aesthetic emptiness. He   has been able to follow the spirit that early appointed him the   interpreter of his country, a country that had long waited for   someone to bestow on it a voice. It is not too much to call such   a life’s work great.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Reymont has   acknowledged that the idea of his book was evoked by\nLa   Terre\n, not through his admiration of it, but through the   indignation and opposition it provoked. He found in it a   conventionalized, distorted, and coarse characterization of the   class of society in which he had grown up and which he loved with   all the warmth that had been cherished by his childhood memories.   He knew this class of society from abundant experience, from   within, and with full understanding – not, like Zola, merely   through hasty journalistic studies made in accordance with a   program mapped out beforehand with preconceived results; and he   wished to describe it in its reality, without any distortion   through theories. But Zola had a decisive influence on the work   in a quite different and more positive fashion.\nChlopi\n(1904-09) [\nThe Peasants\n], in the final form in which we   have it, would hardly be conceivable without the lessons that   Reymont learned from Zola’s work as a whole – its searching   description of the environment, its orchestral mass effects, its   uncompromising verism, and the harmonious working together of   external nature and human life. Nevertheless\nChlopi\n,   rather than turning out to be a naturalistic novel, has taken on   epic proportions – certainly naturalistic in method but epic in   scope.\nFor us moderns that which most profoundly marks a narrative poem   as an epic, is a certain completeness and harmony, a general   impression of rest, however the various episodes may be charged   with suffering and struggle. It is not easy to express this   effect in a conceptual form, for it is our feelings that perceive   it. It achieves its results mainly from the fact that all the   elements of strife and unrest are gradually smoothed out before   us, like waves that wrestle with one another; the circles never   reach as far as the tranquil horizon that bounds the poem; the   unrest puts no question and sends no lament beyond that limit.   The world that we have before our eyes is a definite one and is   unshakable in its foundations; but it is not a world of   compulsion and imprisonment. It is wide enough for human beings   to express themselves in action according to the measure of their   powers. Hence the harmony of the poem. Whatever happiness is   recorded, the most irremediable suffering – the disparity between   given reality and ideal requirements – is not to be found there,   or at least it does not reach consciousness. The most permanently   bitter tragedy, that which from within shatters a being to   fragments, has not yet been created; the figures we see are   entire and simple and move in\none\npiece. Whether the   figures be large or small, whether their features be fair or   foul, they assume a kind of plastic beauty and   monumentality.\nIt is this that the Polish writer has attained in\nChlopi\n;   and that he achieved it, in spite of a quite modern training   which scarcely promised to lead to such a goal, is surely due to   the fact that his chosen subject moved of itself toward this   happy form. He probably did not seek the form himself – that is   evidenced by the rest of his very different production; but when   it offered itself to him in the course of his work, he understood   it and followed its laws. This is surely merit enough and worthy   of great honour.\nHis Polish peasants possess in their primitive conditions, and   perhaps only in consequence thereof, the simple nature, the   archaism in their contours, demanded by epic art – a great   aesthetic value, which, however, has been obtained at the expense   of being defective in other ways. This throng of figures has   extremely little of what ordinarily is called character. Among   the men only few have even the raw material of character in   mental energy and firmness; and their working up of this material   inspires but little respect. The manliness which consists in   self-discipline, a sense of responsibility, and a personal grasp   of the idea of right, has barely attained any development beyond   collective and vague mass feeling. What we see of the life of   conscience is the common ground of the village, not the guarded   estate of the individual. Consequently one must not expect more   from the women: hence it is much that in one figure, the sorely   tried Hanus, the pliant forces of her nature become welded   together into a stubborn sense of duty.\nThere is really hardly any moral backbone to be found in this   low-lying tract round the sluggishly flowing river. Passion   bounces in men’s wills like a storm in the reeds, and they bend   before every breath of wind, and a spark sets everything ablaze.   The sense of honesty is uncertain, perhaps chiefly because it has   not had free air to grow in. From time immemorial this people has   had to protect itself against oppression by those who owned the   soil – all they had to subsist on. And when the soil at last   became theirs, the gift came from foreign masters, who grudged   them a soul of their own. The passivity, fatalism, and naive good   humour, which under similar circumstances were developed in their   Slavonic brethren to the east, held no power in the Polish   temperament. Here we meet instead a peculiar nervousness which is   not elsewhere a characteristic of the peasant, and which readily   expresses itself in anger and violent deeds. All their   ill-treatment has not sufficed to crush their pride, but that   pride is abundantly mixed with vanity; it is touchy, lacking in   balance, and gives no trustworthy support to human dignity. Their   virtues have as little root as those of children. They consist in   directness, in easily stirred susceptibility, in inflexible and   lively spirits: they point to a superfluity of unexhausted gifts;   and over the whole there extends a never-failing charm, a certain   glamour of nobility. But above all, these people appeal to us   through their strong imaginative life. In their poverty and   frailty they have windows opened to the world of dreams; and all   that is tender and good and beautiful in them flourishes   there.\nThe Church has preserved for them this city of refuge, and to her   they are attached with a deep love, piety, and reverence; through   her, they expect some day atonement and transfiguration; and in a   poetical sense they are already partaking of these good things.   By constantly returning to this feature Reymont has contrived to   keep the air of beauty over his epic.\nWithout effort, he has found the gleam of heroism which an epic   needs, although his subject matter did not provide him with   heroic figures. Heroism was to be found only in their primitively   strong, deep attachment to the soil, which gives and takes their   lives and lends to their struggle and their love something of the   greatness of the forces of nature. Epic breadth and greatness   have been attained, too, through the simple touch of genius in   the composition of the work, which has been cast in the form of a   cycle of the seasons. Autumn, winter, spring, and summer, in   symphonically balanced parts, give their contrasts and their   harmony in a mighty hymn to life; and when the year has swung   full circle in the vicissitudes of human fate, it continues in   our imagination in constant novelty and constant recurrence. he   episodes in the richly developed action do not occur once only:   they have a typical validity. Whether they are idyllic or   passionate, tragically wild or merrily diverting, they have all   been turned to a rhythm of «Works and Days» in a kind   of Hesiodic peasant-world: they have in them a dash of the   eternal youth of the earth.\nThe monotony tending to threaten the peasant novel through its   diffuseness of detail, has here generally been avoided by the   range and the mobility of the material. Unity of style has been   combined with an uncommon power and delight in colour in the   painting of the several parts; and the characterization of the   figures, in their dramatic working, has received due attention   within the given frame. Everything gives the impression of a   reality faithfully described – possibly with one exception, the   chief female character Jagna, who is quite as much a symbol as a   type. But the symbol is poetically justified. In fact, it is the   poetry of the Polish soil and the Polish peasant woman, all the   natural magic, the blind working of natural impulses, the pliancy   and imaginativeness, the hunger for beauty, and the absence of   responsibility, which flourish and intoxicate and are smirched   and trampled in times of trouble and guilt. She is the embodiment   of all the flaws that Reymont has revealed in his people, despite   his love for them; yet she also represents all those qualities   which are rich and splendid in human nature. He has made her the   tragic heroine of his work; and if, there as elsewhere (and   perhaps in consequence of a weakness he shares with the circles   he describes), he has passed no clear judgment, he has not   allowed any lessening of the tragic tension.\nTo sum up, this epic novel is characterized by an art so grand,   so sure, so powerful, that we may predict a lasting value and   rank for it, not only within Polish literature but also within   the whole of that branch of imaginative writing which has here   been given a distinctive and monumental shape.\n*\nSince no   official ceremony took place, the critical essay was prepared by   Per Hallström in lieu of a presentation speech.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Presentation.

This   provides a better defence for him than anything else against the   repeated accusations of lack of honesty and of acting as a   professional buffoon at the court of democracy. From the very   beginning his convictions have been so firm that it seems as if   the general process of development, without having any   substantial influence on himself, has carried him along to the   tribune from which he now speaks. His ideas were those of a   somewhat abstract logical radicalism; hence they were far from   new, but they received from him a new definiteness and   brilliance. In him these ideas combined with a ready wit, a   complete absence of respect for any kind of convention, and the   merriest humour – all gathered together in an extravagance which   has scarcely ever before appeared in literature.\nWhat puzzled people most was his rollicking gaiety: they were   ready to believe that the whole thing was a game and a desire to   startle. This was so far from being true that Shaw himself has   been able to declare with a greater justice that his careless   attitude was a mere stratagem: he had to fool people into   laughing so they should not hit upon the idea of hanging him. But   we know very well that he would hardly have been frightened out   of his outspokenness by anything that might have happened, and   that he chose his weapons just as much because they suited him as   because they were the most effective. He wielded them with the   certitude of genius, which rested on an absolutely quiet   conscience and on a faithful conviction.\nEarly he became a prophet of revolutionary doctrines, quite   varied in their value, in the spheres of aesthetics and   sociology, and he soon won for himself a notable position as a   debater, a popular speaker, and a journalist. He set his mark on   the English theatre as a champion of Ibsen and as an opponent of   superficial tradition, both English and Parisian. His own   dramatic production began quite late, at the age of thirty-six,   in order to help satisfy the demands that he had aroused. He   wrote his plays with instinctive sureness, based on the certainty   that he had a great deal to say.\nIn this casual manner he came to create what is to some extent a   new kind of dramatic art, which must be judged according to its   own special principles. Its novelty does not lie so much in   structure and form; from his wide-awake and trained knowledge of   the theatre, he promptly and quite simply obtains any scenic   effect he feels necessary for his ends. But the directness with   which he puts his ideas into practice is entirely his own; and so   too are the bellicosity, the mobility, and the multiplicity of   his ideas.\nIn France he has been called the Molière of the twentieth   century; and there is some truth in the parallel, for Shaw   himself believes that he was following classical tendencies in   dramatic art. By classicism he means the rigorously rational and   dialectical bent of mind and the opposition to everything that   could be called romanticism.\nHe began with what he calls\nPlays Unpleasant\n(1898), so   named because they brought the spectator face to face with   unpleasant facts and cheated him of the thoughtless entertainment   or sentimental edification that he expected from the stage. These   plays dwell on serious abuses – the exploitation and prostitution   of poor people, while those who perpetrate these abuses manage to   retain their respectability.\nIt is characteristic of Shaw that his orthodox socialistic   severity toward the community is combined with a great freedom   from prejudice and a genuine psychological insight when he deals   with the individual sinner. Even in these early pieces one of his   finest qualities, his humanity, is fully and clearly   marked.\nPlays Pleasant\n(1898), with which he varied his program,   have on the whole the same purport but are lighter in tone. With   one of these he gained his first great success. This was\nArms   and the Man\n, an attempt to demonstrate the flimsiness of   military and heroic romance, in contrast to the sober and prosaic   work of peace. Its pacifist tendency won from the audience a more   ready approbation than the author had generally received. In\nCandida\n, a kind of\nDoll’s House\nwith a happy   ending, he created the work which for a long time was his most   poetical one. This was due chiefly to the fact that in this play   the strong superior woman which for him – for reasons unknown to   us – has become the normal type, has here been given a richer,   warmer, and more gentle soul than elsewhere.\nIn\nMan and Superman\n(1903) he took his revenge by   proclaiming that woman, because of her resolute and undisguisedly   practical nature, is destined to be the superman whose coming has   been so long prophesied with such earnest yearning. The jest is   amusing, but its creator seems to regard it more or less   seriously, even if one takes into account his spirit of   opposition to the earlier English worship of the gentle female   saint.\nHis next great drama of ideas,\nMajor Barbara\n(1905), has a   deeper significance. It discusses the problem of whether evil   ought to be conquered by the inner way, the spirit of joyful and   religious sacrifice; or by the outer way, the eradication of   poverty, the real foundation of all social defects. Shaw’s   heroine, one of his most remarkable female characters, ends in a   compromise between the power of money and that of the Salvation   Army. The process of thought is here carried out with great   force, and naturally with a great deal of paradox. The drama is   not entirely consistent, but it reveals a surprisingly fresh and   clear conception of the joy and poetry of the life of practical   faith. Shaw the rationalist here shows himself more liberal and   more chivalrous than is customary with the type.\nTime does not permit us to hint at the course of his further   campaign even in his more outstanding works: suffice it to say   that without a trace of opportunism he turns his weapons against   everything that he conceives as prejudice in whatever camp it may   be found. His boldest assault would seem to be in\nHeartbreak   House\n(1919), where he sought to embody – always in the light   of the comic spirit – every kind of perversity, artificiality,   and morbidity that flourishes in a state of advanced   civilization, playing with vital values, the hardening of the   conscience, and the ossification of the heart, under a frivolous   preoccupation with art and science, politics, money-hunting, and   erotic philandering. But, whether owing to the excessive wealth   of the material or to the difficulty of treating it gaily, the   piece has sunk into a mere museum of eccentricities with the   ghost-like appearance of a shadowy symbolism.\nIn\nBack to Methuselah\n(1921) he achieved an introductory   essay that was even more brilliant than usual, but his dramatic   presentation of the thesis, that man must have his natural age   doubled many times over in order to acquire enough sense to   manage his world, furnished but little hope and little joy. It   looked as if the writer of the play had hypertrophied his wealth   of ideas to the great injury of his power of organic   creation.\nBut then came\nSaint Joan\n(1923), which showed this man of   surprises at the height of his power as a poet. This it did   especially on the stage, where all that was most valuable and   central in the play was thrown into due relief and revealed its   real weight, even against the parts that might evoke opposition.   Shaw had not been happy in his previous essays in historical   drama; and this was natural enough, as he happened to combine   with his abundant and quick intelligence a decided lack of   historical imagination and sense of historical reality. His world   lacked one dimension, that of time, which according to the newest   theories is not without significance for space. This led to an   unfortunate lack of respect for all that had once been and to a   tendency to represent everything as diametrically opposite to   what ordinary mortals had previously believed or said.\nIn\nSaint Joan\nhis good head still cherishes the same   opinion on the whole, but his good heart has found in his heroine   a fixed point in the realm of the unsubstantial, from which it   has been able to give flesh and blood to the visions of the   imagination. With doubtful correctness he has simplified her   image, but he has also made uncommonly fresh and living the lines   that remain, and he has endowed\nSaint Joan\nwith the power   of directly holding the multitude. This imaginative work stands   more or less alone as a revelation of heroism in an age hardly   favourable to genuine heroism. The mere fact that it did not fail   makes it highly remarkable; and the fact that it was able to make   a triumphal progress all around the world is in this case   evidence of considerable artistic worth.\nIf from this point we look back on Shaw’s best works, we find it   easier in many places, beneath all his sportiveness and defiance,   to discern something of the same idealism that has found   expression in the heroic figure of Saint Joan. His criticism of   society and his perspective of its course of development may have   appeared too nakedly logical, too hastily thought out, too   unorganically simplified; but his struggle against traditional   conceptions that rest on no solid basis and against traditional   feelings that are either spurious or only half genuine, have   borne witness to the loftiness of his aims. Still more striking   is his humanity; and the virtues to which he has paid homage in   his unemotional way – spiritual freedom, honesty, courage, and   clearness of thought – have had so very few stout champions in   our times.\nWhat I have said has given a mere glimpse of Shaw’s life-work,   and scarcely anything has been said about his famous prefaces –   or rather treatises – accompanying most of the plays. Great parts   of them are insurpassable in their clarity, their quickness, and   their brilliance. The plays themselves have given him the   position of one of the most fascinating dramatic authors of our   day, while his prefaces have given him the rank of the Voltaire   of our time – if we think only of the best of Voltaire. From the   point of view of a pure and simple style they would seem to   provide a supreme, and in its way classic, expression of the   thought and polemics of an age highly journalistic in tone, and,   even more important, they strengthen Shaw’s distinguished   position in English literature.\nAt the banquet, Mr. Shaw’s thanks were   presented by the British Ambassador, Sir Arthur Grant Duff, who   expressed particular appreciation of the fact that the Prize   given to Mr. Shaw would be used to strengthen the cultural   relations between Sweden and Great Britain.\n* The Nobel Prize   in Literature 1925 was announced on November 11, 1926\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

There she spent her childhood and her youth, and from the natural surroundings and the life of the people she drew the impressions which later became the inspiration and the soul of her literary work.\nFrom the window of her house she could see the nearby mountains of Orthobene with their dark forests and jagged grey peaks. Farther off was a chain of limestone mountains which sometimes appeared violet, sometimes lemon-coloured, sometimes dark blue, depending on the variations of the light. And in the distance, the snowy peaks of Gennargentù emerged.\nNuoro was isolated from the rest of the world. The few visitors to the town usually arrived on horseback, with the women mounted behind the men. The monotony of daily life was interrupted only by traditional religious or popular holidays and by the songs and dances in the main street at carnival time.\nIn this environment, Grazia Deledda’s view of life developed into something uniquely ingenuous and primitive. In Nuoro it was not considered shameful to be a bandit. «Do you think», says an old peasant woman in one of Deledda’s novels, «that bandits are bad people? Well, you’re wrong. They are only men who need to display their skill, that’s all. In the old days men went to war. Now there aren’t any more wars, but men still need to fight. And so they commit their holdups, their thefts, and their cattle stealing, not to do evil but only to display somehow their ability and their strength.» Thus the bandit rather enjoys the sympathy of the people. If he is caught and put in prison, the peasants have an expressive phrase which means that he has «run into trouble». And when he is freed no stigma is attached to him. In fact, when he returns to his home town, he is greeted with the words, «More such trouble a hundred years from now!»\nThe vendetta is still the custom in Sardinia, and a person is respected if he takes blood revenge on the killer of a kinsman. Indeed, it is considered a crime to betray the avenger. One author writes, «Even if the reward on his head were three times its size, not a single man in the whole district of Nuoro could be found to betray him. Only one law reigns there: respect for a man’s strength and scorn of society’s justice.»\nIn this town, so little influenced by the Italian mainland, Grazia Deledda grew up surrounded by a savagely beautiful natural setting and by people who possessed a certain primitive grandeur, in a house that had a sort of biblical simplicity about it. «We girls», Grazia Deledda writes, «were never allowed to go out except to go to Mass or to take an occasional walk in the countryside.» She had no chance to get an advanced education, and like the other middle-class children in the area, she went only to the local school. Later she took a few private lessons in French and Italian because her family spoke only the Sardinian dialect at home. Her education, then, was not extensive. However, she was thoroughly acquainted with and delighted in the folk songs of her town with its hymns to the saints, its ballads, and its lullabies. She was also familiar with the legends and traditions of Nuoro. Furthermore, she had an opportunity at home to read a few works of Italian literature and a few novels in translation, since by Sardinian standards her family was relatively well-to-do. But this was all. Yet the young girl took a great liking to her studies, and at only thirteen she wrote a whimsical but tragic short story, «Sangue Sardo» (1888) [Sardinian Blood], which she succeeded in publishing in a Roman newspaper. The people at Nuoro did not at all like this display of audacity, since women were not supposed to concern themselves with anything but domestic duties. But Grazia Deledda did not conform; instead she devoted herself to writing novels: first,\nFior di Sardegna\n[Flower of Sardinia], published in 1892; then\nLa via del male\n(1896) [The Evil Way],\nIl vecchio della montagna\n(1900) [The Old Man of the Mountain],\nElias Portolú\n(1903), and others with which she made a name for herself She came to be recognized as one of the best young female writers in Italy.\nShe had, in fact, made a great discovery – she had discovered Sardinia. In the middle of the eighteenth century a new movement had arisen in European literature. Writers at that time were tired of the models constantly drawn from Greek and Roman literature. They wanted something new. Their movement quickly joined forces with another which had begun in the same epoch with Rousseau’s adoration of man in his natural state, untouched by civilization. The new school formed from these two movements advanced and gained force, articularly in the great days of Romanticism. The school’s most recent trophies have been won by the work of Grazia Deledda. It is true that in descriptions of local colour and peasant life she had predecessors even in her own country. The so-called «regionalist» school in Italian literature had had such notable representatives as Verga, in his descriptions of Sicily, and Fogazzaro, in his descriptions of the Lombardo-Veneto region. But the discovery of Sardinia decidedly belongs to Grazia Deledda. She knew intimately every corner of her native land. She stayed in Nuoro until she was twenty-five; only then did she find the courage to go to Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia. Here she met Madesani, the man whom she married in 1900. After her marriage she and her husband moved to Rome, where she divided her time between her work as a writer and her family duties. In the novels written after she moved to Rome, she continued to deal with Sardinian subjects as in the work entitled\nL’Edera\n(1908) [The Ivy]. But in the novels written after\nL’Edera\n, the action frequently takes place in a less localized atmosphere, as, for example, in her most recent novel\nLa Fuga in Egitto\n(1925) [The Flight into Egypt], which the Academy has examined and appreciated. However, her conception of man and nature is, as always, fundamentally Sardinian in character. Although she is now artistically more mature, she remains the same serious, eloquent, but unpretentious writer who wrote\nLa via del male\nand\nElias Portolú\n.\nIt is rather difficult for a foreigner to judge the artistic merit of her style. I shall therefore quote one of the most famous Italian critics on this matter. «Her style», he writes, «is that of the great masters of the narrative; it has the characteristic marks of all great novelists. No one in Italy today writes novels which have the vigour of style, th power of craftsmanship, the structure, or the social relevance which i found in some, even the latest, works of Grazia Deledda such as\nLa Madre\n(1920) [\nThe Mother\n] and\nIl Segreto dell’uomo solitario\n(1921) [The Secret of the Solitary Man].» One might note only that her composition does not have the strong consistency which might be desired; unexpected passages often give the impression of hasty transitions. But this defect is more than generously compensated for by her many virtues. As a painter of nature she has few equals in European literature. She does not uselessly waste her vivid colours; but even then, the nature which she describes has the simple, broad lines of ancient landscapes, as it has their chaste purity and majesty. It is a marvellously lively nature in perfect harmony with the psychological life of her characters. Like a truly great artist, she succeeds in incorporating her representation of people’s sentiments and customs into her descriptions of nature. Indeed, one need only recall the classic description of the pilgrim’s sojourn on Mount Lula in\nElias Portolú\n. They depart on a May morning. Family after family ascends toward the ancient votive church, some on horseback, some in old wagons. They carry along enough provisions to last a week. The wealthier families lodge in the great shelter standing next to the church. These families are descended from the church’s founders, and each has a spike in the wall and a hearth to indicate the area which belongs to it. No one else can set foot in this area. Each evening the families gather in their respective areas for as long as the feast lasts. They cook their food over the fireplace and tell legends, play music, and sing during the long summer night. In the novel\nLa via del male\n, Grazia Deledda describes equally vividly the strange Sardinian marriage and funeral customs. When a funeral is to take place, all of the doors are shut, all of the shutters are closed, every fire is put out, no one is permitted to prepare food, and hired mourners wail their improvised dirges. The descriptions of such primitive customs are so lifelike and so simple and natural that we are almost moved to call them Homeric. In Grazia Deledda’s novels more than in most other novels, man and nature form a single unity. One might almost say that the men are plants which germinate in the Sardinian soil itself The majority of them are simple peasants with primitive sensibilities and modes of thought, but with something in them of the grandeur of the Sardinian natural setting. Some of them almost attain the stature of the monumental figures of the Old Testament. And no matter how different they may seem from the men we know, they give us the impression of being incontestably real, of belonging to real life. They in no way resemble theatrical puppets. Grazia Deledda is a master of the art of fusing realism with idealism.\nShe does not belong to that band of writers who work on a thesis and discuss problems. She has always kept herself far removed from the battles of the day. When Ellen Key once tried to interest her in such discussions, she answered, «I belong to the past.» Perhaps this confession of attitude is not completely just. Certainly Grazia Deledda feels tied by strong bonds to the past, to the history of her people. But she also knows how to live in and respond to her own times. Although she lacks interest in theories, she has a great deal of interest in every aspect of human life. She writes in a letter, «Our great anguish is life’s slow death. This is why we must try to slow life down, to intensify it, thus giving it the richest possible meaning. One must try to live above one’s life, as a cloud above the sea.» Precisely because life seems so rich and admirable to her, she has never taken sides in the political, social, or literary controversies of the day. She has loved man more than theories and has lived her own quiet life far from the world’s uproar. «Destiny», she writes in another letter, «caused me to be born in the heart of lonely Sardinia. But even if I had been born in Rome or Stockholm, I should not have been different. I should have always been what I am – a soul which becomes impassioned about life’s problems and which lucidly perceives men as they are, while still believing that they could be better and that no one else but themselves prevents them from achieving God’s reign on earth. Everything is hatred, blood, and pain; but, perhaps, everything will be conquered one day by means of love and good will.»\nThese last words express her vision of life, a serious and profound vision with a religious cast. It is frequently sad, but never pessimistic. She believes that the forces of good ultimately will triumph in the life struggle. The principle which dominates all her work as a writer is represented clearly and concisely at the end of her novel\nCenere\n(1904) [\nAshes\n]. Anania’s mother is ruined. In order not to be an obstacle to her son’s happiness, she has taken her own life and now lies dead before him. When he was only a baby, she had given him an amulet. He opens it and finds that it contains only ashes. «Yes, all was ashes: life, death, man; the very destiny which produced her. And still in the last hour, as he stood before the body of the most miserable of human creatures, who after doing and suffering evil in all of its manifestations had died for someone else’s good, he remembered that among the ashes there often lurks the spark of a luminous and purifying flame. And he hoped. And he still loved life»\nAlfred Nobel wanted the Prize in Literature to be given to someone who, in his writings, had given humanity that nectar which infuses the health and the energy of a moral life. In conformity with his wishes, the Swedish Academy has awarded the Prize to Grazia Deledda, «for her idealistically inspired writings which with plastic clarity picture the life on her native island and with depth and sympathy deal with human problems in general.»\nAt the banquet, Archbishop\nNathan Söderblom\n, Member of the\nSwedish Academy\n, addressed the laureate: «Dear Madame – The proverb says, ‹All roads lead to Rome› In your literary work, all roads lead to the human heart. You never tire of listening affectionately to its legends, its mysteries, conflicts, anxieties, and eternal longings. Customs as well as civil and social institutions vary according to the times, the national character and history, faith and tradition, and should be respected religiously. To do otherwise and reduce everything to a uniformity would be a crime against art and truth. But the human heart and its problems are everywhere the same. The author who knows how to describe human nature and its vicissitudes in the most vivid colours and, more important, who knows how to investigate and unveil the world of the heart – such an author is universal, even in his local confinement.\nYou, Madame, do not limit yourself to man; you reveal, first of all, the struggle between man’s bestiality and the high destiny of his soul. For you the road is extended. You have seen the road sign which many travellers pass by without noticing. For you the road leads to God. For this reason you believe in rebirth in spite of the degradation and frailty of man. You know that it is possible to reclaim the swamp so that it becomes firm and fertile land. Therefore, a bright ray gleams in your books. Through darkness and human misery you let shine the solace of eternal light.»\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nThe translation into Italian:\nFrom\nLes Prix Nobel\nen 1927\n, Editor Carl Gustaf Santesson, [Nobel Foundation], Stockholm, 1928\n* The Nobel Prize in Literature 1926 was announced on November 10, 1927.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

If one believes these words, it appears immediately with regard to Bergson’s system how he has made fruitful the intuitive discovery that opens the gate to the world of his thought. This discovery is set forth in his doctoral thesis,\nEssai sur les données immédiates de la conscience\n(1889) [\nTime and Free Will\n], in which time is conceived not as something abstract or formal but as a reality, indissolubly connected with life and the human self. He gives it the name «duration», a concept that can be interpreted as «living time», by analogy with the life force. It is a dynamic stream, exposed to constant qualitative variations and perpetually increasing. It eludes reflection. It cannot be linked with any fixed point, for it would thereby be limited and no longer exist. It can be perceived and felt only by an introspective and concentrated consciousness that turns inward toward its origin.\nWhat we usually call time, the time which is measured by the movement of a clock or the revolutions of the sun, is something quite different. It is only a form created by and for the mind and action. At the end of a most subtle analysis, Bergson concludes that it is nothing but an application of the form of space. Mathematical precision, certitude, and limitation prevail in its domain; cause is distinguished from effect and hence rises that edifice, a creation of the mind, whose intelligence has encircled the world, raising a wall around the most intimate aspirations of our minds toward freedom. These aspirations find satisfaction in «living time»: cause and effect here are fused; nothing can be foreseen with certainty, for certainty resides in the act, simple in itself, and can be established only by this act. Living time is the realm of free choice and new creations, the realm in which something is produced only once and is never repeated in quite the same manner. The history of the personality originates in it. It is the realm where the mind, the soul, whatever one may call it, by casting off the forms and habits of intelligence becomes capable of perceiving in an inner vision the truth about its own essence and about the universal life which is a part of our self.\nIn his purely scientific account, the philosopher tells us nothing of the origin of this intuition, born perhaps of a personal experience skilfully seized upon and probed, or perhaps of a liberating crisis of the soul. One can only guess that this crisis was provoked by the heavy atmosphere of rationalistic biology that ruled toward the end of the last century. Bergson had been brought up and educated under the influence of this science, and when he decided to take up arms against it, he had a rare mastery of its own weapons and full knowledge of the necessity and grandeur it had in its own realm, the conceptual construction of the material world. Only when rationalism seeks to imprison life itself in its net does Bergson seek to prove that the dynamic and fluid nature of life passes without hindrance across its meshes.\nEven if I were competent, it would still be impossible to give an account of the subtlety and scope of Bergson’s thought in the few minutes at my disposal. The task is even more impossible for one who possesses only a very limited sense of philosophy and has never studied it.\nAt his starting point, the intuition of a living time, Bergson borrows in his analysis, in the development of his concepts, and in the sequence of his proofs, something of the dynamic, flowing, and almost irresistible essence of this intuition. One has to follow every movement; every moment introduces a new element. One has to follow the current, trying to breathe as best one can. There is scarcely time for reflection, for the moment one becomes static oneself, one loses all contact with the chain of reasoning.\nIn a singularly penetrating refutation of determinism our philosopher demonstrates that a universal intellect, which he calls Pierre, could not predict the life of another person, Paul, except in so far as he can follow Paul’s experiences, sensations, and voluntary acts in all their manifestations, to the extent of becoming identical with him as completely as two equal triangles coincide. A reader who wants to understand Bergson completely must to a certain extent identify himself with the author and fulfil enormous requirements of power and flexibility of mind.\nThis is by no means to say that there is no point in following the author in his course, for good or ill. Imagination and intuition are sometimes capable of flights where intelligence lags behind. It is not always possible to decide whether the imagination is seduced or whether the intuition recognizes itself and lets itself be convinced. In any event, reading Bergson is always highly rewarding.\nIn the account, so far definitive, of his doctrine,\nL’Évolution créatrice\n, the master has created a poem of striking grandeur, a cosmogony of great scope and unflagging power, without sacrificing a strictly scientific terminology. It may be difficult at times to profit from its penetrating analysis or from the profundity of its thought; but one always derives from it, without any difficulty, a strong aesthetic impression.\nThe poem, if one looks at it in that way, presents a sort of drama. The world has been created by two conflicting tendencies. One of them represents matter which, in its own consciousness, tends downwards; the second is life with its innate sentiment of freedom and its perpetually creative force, which tends increasingly toward the light of knowledge and limitless horizons. These two elements are mingled, prisoners of each other, and the product of this union is ramified on different levels.\nThe first radical difference is found between the vegetable and the animal world, between immobile and mobile organic activity. With the help of the sun, the vegetable world stores up the energy it extracts from inert matter; the animal is exempt from this fundamental task because it can draw energy already stored up in the vegetables from which it frees the explosive force simultaneously and proportionately to its needs. At a higher level in the chain, the animal world lives at the expense of the animal world, being able, due to this concentration of energy, to accentuate its development. The evolutionary paths thus become more and more diverse and their choice is in no way blind: instinct is born at the same time as the organs that it utilizes. Intellect is also existent in an embryonic stage, but still mind is inferior to instinct.\nAt the top of the chain of being, in man, intelligence becomes predominant and instinct subsides, without however disappearing entirely; it remains latent in the consciousness that unites all life in the current of «living time»; it comes into play in the intuitive vision. The beginnings of intelligence are modest and manifestly timid. Intelligence is expressed only by the tendency and the ability to replace organic instruments instinctively by instruments sprung from inert matter, and to make use of them by a free act. Instinct was more conscious of its goal, but this goal was, on the other hand, greatly limited; intelligence engaged itself, on the contrary, in greater risks, but tended also toward infinitely vaster goals, toward goals realized by the material and social culture of the human race. Inevitably a risk existed, however: intelligence, created to act in the spatial world, might distort the image of the world by the modality thus acquired from its concept of life and might remain deaf to its innermost dynamic essence and to the freedom that presides over its eternal variation. Hence the mechanistic and deterministic conception of an external world created by the conquests of intelligence in the natural sciences.\nWe will find ourselves, then, irremediably cornered in an impasse, without any consciousness of freedom of mind and cut off from the sources of life we carry within us, unless we also possess the gift of intuition when we trace ourselves back to our origin. Perhaps one can apply to this intuition, the central point of the Bergsonian doctrine, the brilliant expression that he uses about intelligence and instinct: the perilous way toward vaster possibilities. Within the limits of its knowledge, intelligence possesses logical certainty, but intuition, dynamic like everything that belongs to living time, must without doubt content itself with the intensity of its certainty.\nThis is the drama: creative evolution is disclosed, and man finds himself thrust on stage by the\nélan vital\nof universal life which pushes him irresistibly to act, once he has come to the knowledge of his own freedom, capable of divining and glimpsing the endless route that has been travelled with the perspective of a boundless field opening onto other paths. Which of these paths is man going to follow?\nIn reality we are only at the beginning of the drama, and it can scarcely be otherwise, especially if one considers Bergson’s concept that the future is born only at the moment in which it is lived. However, something is lacking in this beginning itself. The author tells us nothing of the will inherent in the free personality, of the will that determines action and that has the power to trace straight lines across the unforeseeable curves of this personality. Furthermore, he tells us nothing about the problem of life dominated by will power, about the existence or non-existence of absolute values.\nWhat is the essence of the irresistible\nélan vital\n, that onslaught of life against the inertia of matter, which, according to Bergson’s audacious and magnificent expression, will one day triumph perhaps over death itself? What will it make of us when it places at our feet all earthly power?\nHowever complicated they may be, one cannot escape these questions. Is the philosopher perhaps at this very moment on his way to the solution, certainly as tentative and audacious as his previous work has been and richer still in possibilities?\nThere still remain some points to clarify. Does he perhaps seek to put an end to the dualism of the image he gives of the world in seeking out a kind of\nélan vital\nthat applies to matter? We know nothing in this regard, but Bergson has himself presented his system as constituting, on many points, only an outline that must be completed in its details by the collaboration of other thinkers.\nWe are indebted to him, nevertheless, for one achievement of importance: by a passage he has forced through the gates of rationalism, he has released a creative impulse of inestimable value, opening a large access to the waters of living time, to that atmosphere in which the human mind will be able to rediscover its freedom and thus be born anew.\nIf the outlines of his thought prove sound enough to serve as guides to the human spirit, Bergson can be assured, in the future, of an influence even greater than the influence he is already enjoying. As stylist and as poet, he yields place to none of his contemporaries; in their strictly objective search for truth, all his aspirations are animated by a spirit of freedom which, breaking the servitude that matter imposes, makes room for idealism.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\n* The Nobel Prize in Literature 1927 was announced on November 13, 1928.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

This generation had to pay   dearly for the sense of reality it acquired. It had to pass   through many trials before regaining its inner unity, and some of   its representatives succumbed in the struggle. The women of this   generation were strangely isolated in this disconcerting world.   Far from finding support in a firmly established social rule,   they had, in full consciousness, renounced the heritage of the   past. Hostile to all established social order, which they   considered a useless yoke, they counted only on themselves to   create a new society, consistent with a conviction, doubtless   sincere at bottom, but easily misled.\nWith a lively imagination, Sigrid Undset lived the life of these   women; she portrayed them sympathetically but with merciless   truthfulness. She traced the tragedy of their lives without   embellishing or amplifying it; and she conveyed the evolution of   their destinies with the most implacable logic, which implied the   condemnation of her heroines and of the world in which they were   living. The picture is gripping, as far as the scope of the   personages permits; it is attractive only in its marvellously   fresh and brilliant descriptions of nature. Remaining forever in   the reader’s memory are the excursions on skis in the Norwegian   solitude, the effects of the capricious play of the winter light,   the exhilaration of the icy wind during the run, the mad dance of   the blood in the veins, the spirit of adventure, the joy, the   feeling of life and strength which makes the heart pound. And   Sigrid Undset describes with the same mastery the splendours of   spring, saturated with light and full of promises. In this domain   her art attained greatness quite early.\nThis greatness began to extend to her entire work as soon as she   abandoned the disunified and uprooted beings of the present time   who had attracted her attention, in order to dedicate herself to   the life of a distant past. She was destined by birth to do   pioneer work in this area. Her father was a gifted historian, and   from childhood she had lived in an atmosphere of historic legend   and folklore. Moreover, she acquired a solid historical   knowledge, guided, it would seem, by this premonition of the task   her genius had set for her.\nThere she found the material which truly suited her nature, and   her imagination was confronted with a task adequate to its scope.   The characters she was going to make appear out of the past would   offer a more complete unity and would be of a firmer cast than   the contemporary characters. Far from being confined in a sterile   isolation, they would participate in the great solidarity of past   generations. These great masses would come alive in her work in a   more vivid, firmer shape than the amorphous society of our era.   Here was a great challenge to a writer who felt capable of   carrying a heavy burden.\nIn their fashion, the generations of the Middle Ages also enjoyed   a more varied inner life than the present generation, which   Sigrid Undset found obsessed with the pursuit of sexual   happiness, a quest which also determined their concepts of truth.   These ancestors were strongly determined by the sentiment of   honour and by faith. Here was the rich field for a psychology   adequate to them. Moreover, the author’s imagination was bound to   be attracted by the difficult task of conjuring out of the   darkness of a little known past the external life of former   generations in all its diversity. Sigrid Undset has done so to an   extent that has aroused general admiration.\nIn so far as the inner life is concerned, her work can hardly be   criticized. Intimately combined with the consciousness of the   nation, in her depiction, honour retains all the rigour and all   the weight that it had for the chevaliers and great landowners of   the fourteenth century. The demands of honour are clearly stated,   and the conflicts it creates are worked out regardless of their   brutal consequences. Religious life is described with startling   truth. Under Sigrid Undset’s pen it does not become a continuous   holiday of the mind, penetrating and dominating human nature; it   remains, as in our day, insecure and rebellious, and is often   even harsher. Profoundly conscious of the hold of faith on these   inexperienced and unpolished souls, the author has given it, in   the grave hours of existence, an overwhelming power.\nThe erotic life, the problem common to the two sexes, which   constitutes the centre of Sigrid Undset’s psychological interest,   is found again, almost without modifications, in her historical   novels. In this respect, objections naturally come to mind. In   medieval documents, the feminist question is not known; one never   finds hints of the inner personal life which later was to raise   this question. The historian, demanding proofs, has the right to   note this discrepancy. But the historian’s claim is not absolute;   the poet has at least an equal right to express himself when he   relies on a solid and intuitive knowledge of the human soul. The   archaeologist must admit that there existed in the past   instruments of a nature other than those which have come down to   us, not to mention the often fortuitous ways in which the   memories of the past have reached us. The poet has the right to   suppose that human nature has hardly varied in the course of   ages, even if the annals of the past are silent in certain   regards.\nIn spite of the laws imposed by necessity, the common life of man   and woman could scarcely have been peaceful and simple. It was no   doubt less noisy than in our day, but it was exempt from neither   conflicts nor bloody disturbances. To these conflicts and   disturbances Sigrid Undset gave a voice, although it sometimes   seems that the voice had accents far too modern and that the   sentiments were too subtle for an era in which the influence of   poetry had not yet manifested itself. The heavier and harsher   environment seems also to have been of a nature which hardened   the characters more firmly. But it is to this dissemblance, if   indeed one can speak of dissemblance, that her poetic work owes   its poignant and evocative life. In the inevitable compromise   between the present and the past, from which the historical novel   cannot escape, Sigrid Undset has chosen a richly rewarding   way.\nHer narrative is vigorous, sweeping, and at times heavy. It rolls   on like a river, ceaselessly receiving new tributaries whose   course the author also describes, at the risk of overtaxing the   reader’s memory. This stems in part from the very nature of the   subject. In the series of generations, conflicts and destinies   assume a very concentrated form; these are whole masses of clouds   which collide when the lightning flashes. However, this heaviness   is also a result of the author’s ardent and instant imagination,   forming a scene and a dialogue of each incident in the narrative   without taking the necessary backward look at the general   perspective. And the vast river, whose course is difficult to   embrace comprehensively, rolls its powerful waves which carry   along the reader, plunged into a sort of torpor. But the roaring   of its waters has the eternal freshness of nature. In the rapids   and in the falls, the reader finds the enchantment which emanates   from the power of the elements, as in the vast mirror of the   lakes he notices a reflection of immensity, with the vision there   of all possible greatness in human nature. Then, when the river   reaches the sea, when Kristin Lavransdatter has fought to the end   the battle of her life, no one complains of the length of the   course which accumulated so overwhelming a depth and profundity   in her destiny. In the poetry of all times, there are few scenes   of comparable excellence.\nSigrid Undset’s last novel, the two-volume story of\nOlav   Audunssøn\n(1925-27), is generally on a level with the   preceding novel, although it does not soar to its tragic finale.   It attains, however, almost the same height in the scene in which   Olav kills the Icelander. This scene constitutes a magnificent   tableau, a masterly expression of the inner life, with a   loftiness, a justice, an almost superhuman breadth of view rising   above all the atrocities. One rediscovers here the same ripening   of power as in\nKristin Lavransdatter\n(1920-22). As far as   the character studies are concerned, it seems impossible to reach   higher than the portrayal of Eirik, the principal personage of   the last part of the novel. Here is the complete evolution of a   human being, from the first manifestations of childhood which are   recorded not only with a vigorous strictness but also with a   surprising superimposition of new traits, proportionate to the   increasing clarity in the character delineation. One sees a human   soul freely develop under one’s eyes, a true creation of a truly   superior art.\nSigrid Undset has received the Nobel Prize in Literature while   still in her prime, an homage rendered to a poetic genius whose   roots must be in a great and well-ordered spirit.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

By setting forth the innermost, secret experiences of the   human soul against the background of contemporary social   conditions, and by stressing the interdependence of the general   and the particular, it has been able to portray reality with a   faithful accuracy and a completeness that have no parallels in   older literature.\nThe realistic novel – one could call it a modern prose epic   influenced by historicism and science – has by and large been the   creation of the English, the French, and the Russians; it is   associated with the names of Dickens and Thackeray, Balzac and   Flaubert, Gogol and Tolstoy. There was no comparable contribution   from Germany for a long time; poetic creativity there chose other   outlets. The nineteenth century had come to its end when a young   writer, the twenty-seven-year-old son of a merchant from the old   Hanse city of Lübeck, published his novel\nBuddenbrooks\n(1901). Twenty-seven years have passed since   then, and it has become clear to all that\nBuddenbrooks\nis   the masterpiece that fills the gap. Here is the first and as yet   unsurpassed German realistic novel in the grand style which takes   its undisputed and equal place in the European concert.\nBuddenbrooks\nis a bourgeois novel, for the century it   portrays was above all a bourgeois era. It depicts a society   neither so great as to bewilder the observer, nor so small and   narrow as to stifle him. This middle level favours an   intelligent, thoughtful, and subtle analysis, and the creative   power itself, the pleasure of epic narration, is shaped by calm,   mature, and sophisticated reflection. We see a bourgeois   civilization in all its nuances, we see the historical horizons,   the changes of time, the changes of generations, the gradual   transition from self-contained, powerful, and un-self-conscious   characters to reflective types of a refined and weak sensibility.   The presentation is lucid yet penetrates beneath the surface to   hidden processes of life; it is powerful but never brutal, and   touches lightly on delicate things; it is sad and serious but   never depressing because it is permeated by a quiet, deep sense   of humour that is iridescently reflected in the prism of ironic   intelligence.\nAs a portrayal of a society, a concrete and objective   representation of reality,\nBuddenbrooks\nhardly has its   equal in German literature. Beyond the limits of its genre,   however, the novel betrays its common features with the German   mind, with metaphysical and musical transcendentalism. The young   writer who had mastered the techniques of literary realism so   perfectly was at heart a convert to Schopenhauer’s pessimism and   Nietzsche’s criticism of civilization, and the main characters of   the novel reveal their ultimate secrets in music.\nBasically\nBuddenbrooks\nis a philosophical novel. The   decline of a family is portrayed from the point of view that a   profound insight into the essence and conditions of life is   irreconcilable with naive\njoie de vivre\nand active energy.   Reflection, self-observation, psychological refinement,   philosophical profundity, and aesthetic sensibility appear to the   young Thomas Mann destructive and disintegrating forces; in one   of his most exquisite stories,\nTonio Kröger\n(1903),   he has found moving words for his love of human life in all its   simplicity. Because he stood outside the bourgeois world that he   portrayed, his vision was free, but he had a nostalgic feeling   for the loss of naiveté, a feeling which gives him   understanding, sympathy, and respect.\nThe painful experience of Mann’s youth that gave its profound   tone to\nBuddenbrooks\nincludes a problem that he has   treated and tried to solve in different ways throughout his   career as a writer. Within himself he has felt the tension   between the aesthetic-philosophical and the pragmatic-bourgeois   outlooks, and he has tried to resolve it in harmony on a higher   level. In the short stories\nTonio Kröger\nand\nTristan\n(1903) the exiles from life, the devotees of art,   knowledge, and death, confess their desire for a simple and   healthy existence, for «life in its seductive   banality». It is Mann’s own paradoxical love for simple and   happy natures that speaks through them.\nIn the novel\nKönigliche Hoheit\n(1909) [\nRoyal   Highness\n], whose realistic form disguises a symbolic story,   he reconciled the life of the artist with that of the man of   action, and he gave a motto to that human ideal: «highness   and love – an austere happiness». But the synthesis is   neither as convincing nor as deeply felt as the antithesis in\nBuddenbrooks\nand the short stories. In the drama\nFiorenza\n(1906), in which the moralist Savonarola and the   aestheticist Lorenzo di Medici appear as irreconcilable enemies,   the gap is opened anew. In\nDer Tod in Venedig\n(1913)   [\nDeath in Venice\n] it reaches tragic significance. It was   during this period, in the years that preceded the World   War, that he became interested in the personality of Frederick   the Great. He felt that that ruler presented a historically valid   solution of the problem, for Frederick’s genius had, with   unbroken vitality, combined action, contemplation, and a   penetrating clarity free from illusions. In the ingenious essay\nFriedrich und die grosse Koalition\n(1915) [\nFrederick   the Great and the Grand Coalition\n] he showed the possibility   and reality of the solution, but the problematic writer of\nBuddenbrooks\ndid not succeed in representing this ideal in   the plastic and vital form of literature.\nThe World War and its consequences forced Mann to leave the   world of contemplation, of ingenious analysis and subtle visions   of beauty, for the world of practical action. He followed his own   advice, implied in his novel\nKönigliche Hoheit\n, to   beware of the easy and the comfortable, and dedicated himself to   an agonizing reappraisal of the questions that his country faced   in its time of affliction. His later works, especially the novel\nDer Zauberberg\n(1924) [\nThe Magic Mountain\n], testify   to the struggle of the ideas which his dialectical nature fought   to the end and which preceded the statement of his   opinions.\nDr. Thomas Mann – As a German writer and thinker you have,   reflecting realities, wrestled with ideas and created painful   beauty even though you were convinced that art is questionable.   You have reconciled the loftiness of poetry and the intellect   with a yearning love for the human and for the simple life.

He was born at Sauk Centre, a place of   about two or three thousand inhabitants in the great cornland of   Minnesota. He describes the place in his novel\nMain Street\n(1920), though there it is called Gopher Prairie.\nIt is the great prairie, an undulating land with lakes and oak   groves, which has produced that little town and many others   exactly like it. The pioneers have need of places to sell their   grain, shops to purchase their supplies, banks for their mortgage   loans, doctors for their bodies, and clergymen for their souls.   There is cooperation between the country and the town, but at the   same time there is conflict. Does the town exist for the sake of   the country, or the country for the town?\nThe prairie makes its power felt. During the winters, long and   cold as ours, terrific storms dump their snow in the wide   streets, between low and shabby houses. The summer scorches with   an intense heat and the town smells, because it lacks both sewers   and street cleaning. Yet the town naturally feels its   superiority; it is the flower of the prairie. It has the economic   threads in its hands, and it is the focus of civilization – a   concentrated, proud America amidst these earth-bound thralls of   foreign origin, Germans and Scandinavians.\nThus the town lives happily in its self-confidence and its belief   in true democracy, which does not exclude a proper stratification   of the people, its faith in a sound business morality, and the   blessings of being motorized; for there are many Fords in Main   Street.\nTo this town comes a young woman filled with rebellious emotions.   She wants to reform the town, inside and out, but fails   completely, almost going under in the attempt.\nAs a description of life in a small town,\nMain Street\nis   certainly one of the best ever written. To be sure, the town is   first and foremost American, but it could, as a spiritual milieu,   be situated just as well in Europe. Like Mr. Lewis, many of us   have suffered from its ugliness and bigotry. The strong satire   has aroused local protests, but one need not be keensighted to   see the tolerant strain in Lewis’s sketch of his native town and   its people.\nBehind the puffed-up complacency of Gopher Prairie, however,   lurks jealousy. At the edge of the plain stand cities like St.   Paul and Minneapolis, already little metropolitan centres with   their skyscraper windows gleaming in the sunlight or the   evening’s electricity. Gopher Prairie wants to be like them and   finds the time ripe for a campaign of progress, based on the   rising war price of wheat.\nA stump orator is imported, a real rabble-rouser of the peppiest   kind, and with blatant eloquence he demonstrates that nothing   will be easier than for Gopher Prairie to take the lead and reach   the 200,000 class.\nMr. Babbitt – George Follansbee Babbitt – is the happy citizen of   such a city (\nBabbitt\n, 1922). It is called Zenith, but   probably it cannot be found on the map under that name. This city   with its enlarged horizons hereafter becomes the starting point   for Mr. Lewis’s critical raids into the territories of   Americanism. The city is a hundred times larger than Gopher   Prairie and, therefore, a hundred times richer in one hundred per   cent Americanism and one hundred times as satisfied with itself,   and the enchantment of its optimism and progressive spirit is   embodied in George F. Babbitt.\nAs a matter of fact, Babbitt probably approaches the ideal of an   American popular hero of the middle class. The relativity of   business morals as well as private rules of conduct is for him an   accepted article of faith, and without hesitation he considers it   God’s purpose that man should work, increase his income, and enjoy   modern improvements. He feels that he obeys these commandments   and therefore lives in complete harmony with himself and   society.\nHis profession, real estate, is the highest in existence, and his   house near the city, with its trees and lawn, is standard, inside   and out. The make of his car corresponds to his position, and in   it he whizzes through the streets, proud as a young hero amidst   the perils of the traffic. His family life also corresponds to   the bourgeois average. His wife has become used to his masculine   rumblings at home, and the children are impertinent, but that is   what one expects.\nHe enjoys excellent health, is well-fed and thriving, alert and   good-natured. His daily lunches at the club are feasts of   instructive business conversation and stimulating anecdotes; he   is sociable and winning. Babbitt is furthermore a man with the gift   of speech. He has learned all the national slogans and whirls   them about with his flowing tongue in his popular talks before   clubs and mass meetings. Not even for the most elevated   spirituality does he lack sympathy. He basks in the company of   the noted poet, Cholmondeley Frink, who concentrates his genius   on the composition of striking, rhymed advertisements for various   firms and thereby earns a good annual income.\nThus Babbitt lives the life of the irreproachable citizen   conscious of his respectability. But the jealousy of the gods   broods over a mortal whose happiness grows too great. A soul such   as Babbitt’s is, of course, incapable of growth; it is a   ready-made article from the start. Then Babbitt discovers that he   has tendencies toward vice which he has neglected – although not   wholly, one ought to add. As he approaches fifty, he hastens to   make up for the neglect. He enters into an irregular relationship   and joins a frivolous gang of youths, in which he plays the role   of a generous sugar daddy. But his deeds find him out. His   lunches at the club become more and more painful through the   silence and aloofness of his friends. They hint that he is   spoiling this chance of future membership in the committee of   progress. Here it is naturally New York and Chicago that loom   before him. He succeeds in recovering his better self, and it is   edifying to see him kneel in his pastor’s study, where he   receives absolution. And then Babbitt can once more devote   himself to the Sunday school and other socially useful   activities. His story ends as it began.\nThat it is institutions as representatives of false ideas, and   not individuals, that Mr. Lewis wants to attack with his satire,   he has himself indicated. It is then a triumph for his art, a   triumph almost unique in literature, that he has been able to   make this Babbitt, who fatalistically lives within the borders of   an earth-bound but at the same time pompous utilitarianism, an   almost lovable individual.\nBabbitt is naive, and a believer who speaks up for his faith. At   bottom there is nothing wrong with the man, and he is so   festively refreshing that he almost serves as a recommendation   for American snap and vitality. There are bouncers and   Philistines in all countries, and one can only wish that half of   them were half as amusing as Babbitt.\nTo the splendour of the figure, as well as to other speaking   characters in the book, Mr. Lewis has added his unparalleled gift   of words. Listen, for example, to the conversation of a few   commercial travellers, sitting together in a compartment of the   New York express. An unsuspected halo falls over the profession   of selling. «To them, the Romantic Hero was no longer the   knight, the wandering poet, the cowpuncher, the aviator, nor the   brave young district attorney, but the great sales manager, who   had an Analysis of Merchandizing Problems on his glass-topped   desk, whose title of nobility was ‹Go-getter› and who   devoted himself and all his young samurai to the cosmic purpose   of Selling – not of selling anything in particular, for or to   anybody in particular, but pure Selling.»\nArrowsmith\n(1925) is a work of a more serious     nature. Lewis has there attempted to represent the medical profession and     science in all its manifestations. As is well known, American research in     the natural sciences, physics, chemistry, and medicine ranks with the     best of our age, and it has several times been recognized as such     from this very platform. Tremendous resources have been placed at     its command. Richly endowed institutions work unceasingly on its     development.\nThat even here some speculative persons want to take advantage of     their opportunities may be regarded as inevitable. Private     industries are on the alert for scientific discoveries and want     to profit from them before they have been tested and finally     established. The bacteriologist, for instance, searches with     infinite care for vaccines to cure widespread diseases, and the     manufacturing chemist wants to snatch them prematurely from his     hand for mass production.\nUnder the guidance of a gifted and conscientious teacher, Martin     Arrowsmith develops into one of the idealists of science. The     tragedy of his life as research worker is that, after making an     important discovery, he delays its announcement for constantly     renewed tests until he is anticipated by a Frenchman in the     Pasteur Institute.\nThe book contains a rich gallery of different medical types. We     have the hum of the medical schools with their quarrelling and     intriguing professors. Then there is the unpretentious country     doctor, recalled from\nMain Street\n, who regards it as an     honour to merge with his clientele and become their support and     solace. Then we have the shrewd organizer of public health and     general welfare, who works himself into popular favour and     political power. Next we have the large institutes with their     apparently royally independent investigators, under a management     which to a certain extent must take into consideration the     commercial interests of the donors and drive the staff to forced     work for the honour of the institutes.\nAbove these types rises Arrowsmith’s teacher, the exiled German     Jew, Gottlieb, who is drawn with a warmth and admiration that     seem to suggest a living model. He is an incorruptibly honest     servant of science, but at the same time a resentful anarchist     and a stand-offish misanthrope, who doubts whether the humanity     whose benefactor he is amounts to as much as the animals he kills     with his experiments. Further we meet the Swedish doctor, Gustaf     Sondelius, a radiant Titan, who with singing and courage pursues     pests in their lairs throughout the world, exterminates poisonous     rats and burns infected villages, drinks and preaches his gospel     that hygiene is destined to kill the medical art.\nAlongside all of this runs the personal history of Martin     Arrowsmith. Lewis is much too clever to make his characters     without blemish, and Martin suffers from faults which at times     seem obstructive to his development, both as a man and as a     scientist. As a restless and irresolute young man he gets his     best help from a little woman he encountered at a hospital where     she was an insignificant nurse. When he begins to drift about the     country as an unsuccessful medical student, he looks her up in a     little village in the Far West, and there she becomes his wife.     She is a devoted and simple soul, who demands nothing and who     patiently waits in her solitude when, bewitched by the siren of     science, her husband loses himself in the labyrinths of his     work.\nLater she accompanies him and Sondelius to the plague-infected     island where Arrowsmith wants to test his serum. Her death in the     abandoned hut, while her husband listens distractedly to another     and more earthy siren than that of science, seems like a     poetically crowning final act to a life of primitive     self-sacrificing femininity.\nThe book is full of admirable learning, certified by experts as     being accurate. Though a master of light-winged words, Lewis is     never superficial when it comes to the foundations of his art.     His study of details is always as careful and thorough as that of     such a scientist as Arrowsmith or Gottlieb. In this work he has     built a monument to the profession of his own father, that of the     physician, which certainly is not represented by a charlatan or a     faker.\nHis big novel\nElmer Gantry\n(1927) is like a surgical     operation on one of the most delicate parts of the social body.     Presumably it would not pay to search anywhere in the world for     the old Puritanical virtues, but possibly one might find in some     of the oldest corners of America a remnant of the sect which     regarded it as a sin to remarry, once it had pleased God to make     one a widower or widow, and wicked to lend money at interest. But     otherwise America has no doubt had to moderate its religious     rigidity. To what extent a pulpiteer like Elmer Gantry is common     over there, we cannot here have the slightest idea. Neither his     slapdash style of preaching with his cocky pugilistic manners     («Hello, Mr. Devil») nor his successful collecting of     money and men inside the gates of the church can hide the sad     fact that he is an unusually foul fish. Mr. Lewis has been     neither willing nor able to give him any attractive traits. But     as description the book is a feat of strength, genuine and     powerful, and its full-flavoured, sombre satire has a devastating     effect. It is unnecessary to point out that hypocrisy thrives a     little everywhere and that any one who attacks it at such a close     range places himself before a hydra with many dangerous     heads.\nSinclair Lewis’s latest work is called\nDodsworth\n(1929).     In his books we have previously caught glimpses of the family as     one of the most aristocratic in Zenith – a circle where no     Babbitt ever gains admission. «Most aristocratic»     probably often means in America «richest», but Sam     Dodsworth is both aristocratic and rich. Even after 300 years he     notices the English blood in his veins and wants to know the land     of his ancestors. He is an American, but not a jingo. With him     travels his wife, Fran. She is already over forty, while he is     fifty. She is a cool beauty, «virginal as the winter     wind», though she has grown children. In the European     atmosphere she blossoms as a brilliant flower of luxury,     revelling in vanity, pleasure, and selfishness. She goes so far     that the quiet man who loves her has to leave her to her     fate.\nOnce alone he meditates on the problem «Europe-America», and as a real business man he wants     to clear up his accounts with both. He thinks of many things,     honestly and without prejudice. One of his observations is that     the very soil of Europe has some of the old-time quiet, which is     scorned by America, the land of restless record-hunters. But     America is the land of youth and daring experiments. And when he     returns there, we understand that the heart of Sinclair Lewis     follows him.\nYes, Sinclair Lewis is an American. He writes the new language –     American – as one of the representatives of 120,000,000 souls. He     asks us to consider that this nation is not yet finished or     melted down; that it is still in the turbulent years of     adolescence.\nThe new great American literature has started with national     self-criticism. It is a sign of health. Sinclair Lewis has the     blessed gift of wielding his landclearing implement not only with     a firm hand but with a smile on his lips and youth in his heart.     He has the manners of a new settler, who takes new land into     cultivation. He is a pioneer.\nMr. Sinclair Lewis – I have spoken of you to this assembly in a     language which you do not understand. I might have abused the     occasion to speak ill of you. I have not done it. I have spoken     of you as one of the strong, young chieftains of the great new     American literature. Besides, you have a special recommendation     to Swedish hearts. You were born among our countrymen in America,     and you have mentioned them in friendly terms in your renowned     books. We are glad to see you here today and glad that our nation     has a laurel of its own to bestow on you. And now I ask you to     descend with me and receive it from the hand of our King.\nAt the banquet, Tor Hedberg, Member of the   Swedish Academy, addressed the laureate: «Finally, Mr.   Lewis, in your person we greet that [American] new building on   its own American ground. It has been said that the Nobel Prize in   Literature has found its way across the Atlantic far too late. If   so, it has not been due to any indifference on the part of the   Swedish Academy, nor to any lack of knowledge, but rather to an   «embarras de richesse». It has further been said that   the award of a prize to your work, in which the follies of   mankind – not excluding those that are perhaps special to America   – have been scourged, is an expression of some kind of European   or Swedish animosity against America. I dare to assert that this   is a complete mistake. It is with living humour that you aim the   blows of your scourge, and where there is humour, there is a   heart too. It is not only the keen and lively intellect, the   masterly design of human shapes and characters but also the warm,   open, gaily-beating heart that we have appreciated in you».   Sinclair Lewis expressed his gratitude and declared that he felt   closely related to the Swedish people because of his many   acquaintances among the Swedish families of Minnesota. He said   that the Nobel Prize had a great significance for him, that it   had in fact created a new standard which implied an obligation to   improve on what he had done so far. Furthermore, he considered it   a high honour to have been awarded the Nobel Prize along with the   renowned scholars who received the distinction. He said that,   personally, he had the profoundest respect for the integrity of   the scientist, and thought that a man of letters, himself   included, should strive for the same integrity.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

People like to talk   of what they love. The Swede would say that we celebrate this   poet because he represents our character with a style and a   genuineness that we should like to be ours, and because he has   sung with singular power and exquisite charm of the tradition of   our people, of all the precious features which are the basis for   our feeling for home and country in the shadow of the   pine-covered mountains.\nBut the Swede would soon check himself, realizing that such a   general explanation is insufficient, that in Karlfeldt there are   many things, beloved but difficult to define, which a proper   appraisal must take into account but which are inaccessible to   the foreigner. Hence we can offer no ready-made expression of our   conviction of the high rank of Karlfeldt’s poetry, for there are   elements of mysticism in it, powers and instincts that elude   analysis.\nWe face a similar difficulty on this occasion when we are to   briefly sketch the life-work of the great lyrical poet, since it   has now been made the object of a great international award. It   is the deliberate self-limitation of lyrical poetry, and at the   same time its fate, that its most profound qualities and values   are indissolubly connected with the character and rhythm of its   original language, with the meaning and weight of every single   word. Karlfeldt’s individuality may be dimly felt in a   translation, but only in Swedish can it be fully comprehended.   However, if one attempts to find independent comparative   criteria, he is forced to admit that even the treasures of the   so-called great literatures have only rarely been enriched by   such jewels as Karlfeldt has created in a so-called minor   language.\nIf we look back on Karlfeldt’s notable career from its début   in 1895 and follow it through the works of three decades, steady   though limited in size by his austere standards, we see very   clearly how this man used his talents with a rare instinct for   the fruitful, the solid, and the genuine. He began as a minstrel   and a singer of nature, conscious of his ability but still   doubtful of his calling. Was there any use for the dreams that   thronged his breast? Could they have a meaning for a whole   people? Early in his career, the poet looked for a deputy, an   alter ego, an independent figure suited to represent his   feelings, his sufferings, and his longing as well as his sarcasm.   The famous Fridolin was at first a creation of shyness, for the   poet was reluctant to appear in his own person and expose the   private life of his soul. Fridolin soon became a classic, and he   has his place in the rout of Northern Bacchus, rustic cousin of   the characters of Bellman, with a firmer gait, but with flowers   on his hat from the harvest festival at Pungmakarebo. Karlfeldt’s   home became more and more an artistic microcosm in which the   universe was mirrored in the same manner as Biblical scenes are   mirrored in the baroque fantasies of the frescoes in the   farmhouses of Dalekarlia. With his sense of humour, which was   often reverence in disguise, he kept his being unstained, and he   preserved the magic ring of harmony. But his seemingly peaceful   development must have contained many struggles and tensions, just   enough to create the necessary pressure for the creative spring.   Poetry was for Karlfeldt a continuous test of the strength and   substance of his being. Thus he gave a powerful finale to his   poetry in Hösthorn (1927) [The Horn of Autumn], his epilogue   played on a winter organ, whose pipes reach from earth to heaven   but at the same time sound a childhood echo of the small white   churches in Dalarna.\nThe unity of his work is a rarity in our time. If one asks about   Karlfeldt’s main problem, one word may serve as an answer:   self-discipline. His originality grew on the soil of a pagan and   luxuriant wilderness, and he would not have been drawn so often   to witch motifs and the pitchy brew of Uriel if he had not felt   the presence of demons. The muffled tumult of nature under the   moon of pagan festivals is one of the visions that he evokes. The   contrast between the heavy intoxication of the blood and the pure   celestial yearnings of the soul recurs constantly in his poetry.   Yet the different elements never destroy each other. He tames   them as does an artist by remaining faithful to himself and by   giving a personal touch even to the smallest detail.\nIn Karlfeldt we find scarcely a single expression of poetic   self-consciousness. The increasing response to his work would   have made such an expression superfluous even if his solid   peasant blood had not been a protection against aesthetic   arrogance. We find everywhere proof of the integrity of   professional honour that is revealed in beautiful and permanent   work. In an age in which handmade things have become rare, there   is a new and almost moral value in the masterly, chiselled, and   resonant language of his verse.\nKarlfeldt’s poetry possesses precisely this stamp of miraculous   perfection. Which of us does not remember such stanzas ringing   like bells or vibrating like strings, but above all sung with   that peculiar and resounding voice that differs from all others?   Perhaps we should remember in this context the beautiful song   about the old turner, the village craftsman, who played the   fiddle for the people on the banks of the Opplimen and made   spinning wheels for them…\nIn all great poetry there is an interrelation between tradition   and experiment, and the principles of renewal and conservation   are contained in such poetry. The national tradition survives in   Karlfeldt because it is renewed personally and has the character   of a conquest dearly bought. We may rejoice that this poet, whose   inspiration is drawn predominantly from a past that is   disappearing or has disappeared, is thoroughly unconventional in   his means of expression and shows daring innovations, whereas   busy modernists often content themselves with following the   latest trends and fads. Nor can there be any doubt that, despite   his provincial subject matter, the singer of Dalarna is one of   the contemporary poets who have most boldly tried the wings of   imagination and experimented with the possibilities of poetic   form.\nThus the decision to honour the poetry of Erik Axel Karlfeldt   with this year’s Nobel Prize is intended as an expression of   justice by international standards. Death has stepped between the   laureate and his reward; under the circumstances the Prize will   be given to his family. He has left us, but his work remains. The   tragic world of chance is outshone by the imperishable summer   realm of poetry. Before our eyes we see the tomb in the dusk of   winter. At the same time we hear the great victorious harmonies   sung by the happiness of the creative genius; we feel the scents   from the Northern pleasure garden that his poetry created for the   comfort and joy of all receptive hearts.\nAt the banquet, Professor C.W. Oseen spoke   about the deceased laureate, «Is there nothing that is only   beneficial, to humanity as well as to the individual? Perhaps   there is! What the poems of Erik Axel Karlfeldt have meant to the   Swedish people, you, honoured guests, cannot know, but for us it   remains unforgettable. For thirty-five years they have   accompanied the ups and downs of our lives. That nothing may   emerge from Karlfeldt’s work, this world of beauty, for the   benefit of humanity and the individual, I cannot believe, I will   not believe. And yet – how far are we from the intentions of   Alfred Nobel even here? Out of the prize meant to help a needy   artist we have made a wreath, a wreath to adorn the coffin of our   most beloved poet.\nIf today’s award does not strictly follow Nobel’s intentions,   does that mean that the result of this procedure will be less   than what Nobel intended? I say not! What we have created is not   less but more! This festive ceremony is a tribute to genius. It   may not have much in common with Alfred Nobel’s dreams but it is   akin to his work. He was a genius himself His work has served   humanity, to build and to destroy. It has served and destroyed   life. The festive occasion we are celebrating is dedicated to   genius with its good and evil faces, with this double   significance, because we do not know what humanity needs most and   what furthers its prospering most: ‹good› or   ‹evil›. We dedicate this ceremony to genius, brother   of madness, to whom we owe everything that makes our lives   worthwhile.»\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Yet he is not   one of those who have turned to the literary career rapidly and   without resistance. Born, as the English put it, with a silver   spoon in his mouth, that is, economically independent, he studied   at Harrow and Oxford, chose the law without practising it,   and travelled all over the world. When, at the age of   twenty-eight, he began writing for the first time, the immediate   reason was the exhortation of a woman friend, and it was to   Galsworthy a mere recreation, evidently not without the inherent   prejudices of the gentleman, against the vocation of writing. His   first two collections of tales were published under the pen name   of John Sinjohn, and the editions were soon withdrawn by the   self-critical beginner. Not until he was thirty-seven did he   begin his real authorship by publishing the novel\nThe Island   Pharisees\n(1904), and two years later appeared\nThe Man of   Property\n, the origin of his fame and at the same time of his   monumental chief work,\nThe Forsyte Saga\n.\nIn Galsworthy’s satire against the Island Pharisees, the   fundamental feature that was to mark all his subsequent works was   already apparent. The book deals with an English gentleman’s   having stayed abroad long enough to forget his conventional   sphere of thoughts and feelings; he criticizes the national   surroundings severely, and in doing so he is assisted by a   Belgian vagabond, who casually makes his acquaintance in an   English railway compartment and who becomes his fate. At that   time Galsworthy was himself a cosmopolite returned home, prepared   to fight against the old capitalistic aristocratic society with   about the same program as\nBernard   Shaw\n, although the Englishman, contrary to the Irishman who   fought with intellectual arms, above all aimed at capturing   feeling and imagination. The pharisaical egoism of England’s   ruling classes, the subject of Galsworthy’s debut, remained his   program for the future, only specialized in his particular works.   He never tired of fighting against all that seemed narrow and   harsh in the national character, and the persistence of his   attacks on social evil indicates his strong impressions and   deeply wounded feeling of justice.\nWith the Forsyte type he now aimed at the upper middle class, the   rich businessmen, a group not yet having reached real gentility,   but striving with its sympathies and instincts toward the   well-known ideal of the gentleman of rigid, imperturbable, and   imposing correctness. These people are particularly on their   guard against dangerous feelings, a fact which, however, does not   exclude accidental lapses, when passion intrudes upon their life,   and liberty claims its rights in a world of property instincts.   Beauty, here represented by Irene, does not like to live with\nThe Man of Property\n; in his bitter indignation at this,   Soames Forsyte becomes almost a tragic figure. It seems uncertain   if in the beginning Galsworthy thought of a sequel to that first   Forsyte novel, which is a masterpiece of an energetic, firm, and   independent account of human nature. At any rate it was not until   fifteen years later that he again took up his Forsytes, and at   this time the effects of the World War had radically changed the   perspective. But now this work expanded;\nIn Chancery\n(1920) and\nTo Let\n(1921) and two short story interludes   were added, and thus\nThe Forsyte Saga\nproper was   completed. Not finished with the younger members of the family,   Galsworthy wrote\nA Modern Comedy\n, a new trilogy whose   structure is exactly like that of its predecessor and consists of   the three novels,\nThe White Monkey\n(1924),\nThe Silver   Spoon\n(1926), and\nSwan Song\n(1928), united by two   short story interludes. These two trilogies together form an   unusual literary accomplishment. The novelist has carried the   history of his time through three generations, and his success in   mastering so excellently his enormously difficult material, both   in its scope and in its depth, remains an extremely memorable   feat in English literature – doubly remarkable, if we consider   that it was performed in a field in which the European continent   had already produced some of its best works.\nIn the foreground of this chronicle is everyday reality, as   experienced by the Forsytes, all personal fortunes, conflicts,   and tragicomedies. But in the background is visible the dark   fabric of historical events. Every reader is sure to remember the   chapter describing how Soames with his second wife witnesses the   funeral of Queen Victoria in grey weather at the Hyde Park fence,   and the rapid survey of the age from her accession to the throne:   «Morals had changed, manners had changed, men had become   monkeys twice removed, God had become Mammon – Mammon so   respectable as to deceive himself.» In the Forsyte novels we   observe the transformation and the dissolution of the Victorian   age up to our days. In the first trilogy comes to life the period   that in England effected the fusion of nobility and plutocracy   with the accompanying change of the notion of a   «gentleman», a kind of Indian summer of wealth before   the days of the storm. The second trilogy, no longer called   «saga» but «comedy», describes the profound   crisis of the new England whose task is to change the ruins of   the past and the improvised barracks of wartime into its future   home. The gallery of types is admirably complete. Robust   businessmen, spoiled society ladies, aunts touching in an   old-fashioned way, rebellious young girls, gentlemen of the   clubs, politicians, artists, children, and even dogs – these   last-mentioned especially favoured by Galsworthy – emerge in the   London panorama in a concrete form, alive before our eyes and   ears.\nThe situations recur as a curious documentation of the   oscillation and the undulation in a family of given hereditary   dispositions. The individual portraits are distinguished, and the   law of social life is at work.\nIt is also instructive, however, to observe in these novels how   Galsworthy’s view gradually changes. The radical critic of   culture rises by degrees to a greater objectivity in his   appreciation and to a more liberal view of the purely human. An   often cited example of this is his treatment of Soames, this   standard national type, at first satirized, but then described   with a respect that, reluctantly growing, finally changes into a   genuine sympathy. Galsworthy has seized upon this sympathy; his   characterization of Soames’s personality thoroughly worked out   becomes the most memorable feature of the Forsyte saga and the   comedy of the descendants. One easily remembers one of those   masterly final episodes of\nSwan Song\n, in which Old Soames,   having driven to his ancestors’ village on the west coast, finds   with the help of an old census map the place where the Forsytes’   farm had been situated, where only a single stone marks the site.   Something like the ghost of a path leads him down into a valley   of grass and furze. He breathes in the fresh, rough sea air which   goes a little to his head; he puts on his overcoat and sits   musing, his back against the stone. Had his ancestors built the   house themselves at this lonely place, had they been the first to   settle down here? he wonders. Their England rises before him, an   England «of pack horses and very little smoke, of peat and   wood fires, and wives who never left you, because they couldn’t   probably». He sits there a long time, absorbed in his   feeling for the birthplace.\n«And something moved in him, as if the salty independence of   that lonely spot were still in his bones. Old Jolyon and his own   father and the rest of his uncles – no wonder they’d been   independent, with this air and loneliness in their blood; and   crabbed with the pickling of it – unable to give up, to let go,   to die. For a moment he seemed to understand even   himself.»\nTo Galsworthy Soames thus becomes one of the last representatives   of static old England. There was no humbug in him, we are told;   he had his trying ways, but he was genuine. The sober prosaic   respectability is in this manner duly honoured in Galsworthy’s   realism, and this has been pointed out as the essential factor in   his judgment of human nature. As time passed, and the weary,   cynical laxity grew more and more visibly modern, the chronicler   found that several traits which under other circumstances had   been little appreciated, perhaps really constituted the secret of   the British power of resistance. On the whole, Galsworthy’s later   novels are permeated with a patriotic feeling of self-defence   that appears also in his descriptions of the home and studies of   nature. Even these last-mentioned are rendered with a more tender   and more anxious poetry, with the feeling of protecting something   precious yet already shadowed by certain loss. It may be old   chambers where people have established themselves as if to remain   there forever. Or it may be an English garden park, where the   September sun is shining beautifully on bronze-coloured beech   leaves and centenary hedges of yew.\nTime does not permit me to dwell in the same detail upon other of   Galsworthy’s works, often quite comparable in quality to the   Forsyte series, which surpasses them by virtue of its epic   dimensions. It is above all in\nThe Country House\n(1907),   in\nFraternity\n(1901), and in\nThe Dark Flower\n(1913)   that his mature essential character is to be sought. In the novel   of the manor he created perhaps his most exquisite female   portrait, Mrs. Pendyce, the type of the perfect, unaffected lady   with all the modest tragedy which surrounds a truly noble nature,   condemned to be restrained if not destroyed by the fetters of   tradition. In\nFraternity\nhe represented, with a discreet   mixture of pity and irony, the unfulfilled martyr of social   conscience, the aesthete who is tortured by the shadows of the   proletarian masses in London, but is not able to take the   decisive step and carry out his altruistic impulse of action.   There we also meet the old original Mr. Stone, the utopian   dreamer with his eternal monologues beneath the night sky, indeed   one of Galsworthy’s most memorable types. Nor do we forget\nThe   Dark Flower\n, which may be called a psychological sonata,   played with a masterly hand and based on the variations of   passion and resignation in the ages of man. Even in the form of   the short story Galsworthy has often been able to evoke an   emotional response through contrasts of shadow and light which   work rather graphically. He can do this in only a few pages which   become animated by his personal style, for example, when he tells   about such a simple case as that of the German shoemaker in   «Quality», the story of the hopeless struggle of good   craftsmanship against low-price industry.\nBy appealing to education and the sense of justice, his narrative   art has always gently influenced contemporary notions of life and   habits of thought. The same is true of his dramatic works, which   were often direct contributions to social discussion and led to   definite reforms at least in one area, the administration of   public prisons in England. His dramas show an unusual richness of   ideas combined with great ingenuity and technical skill in the   working out of scenic effect. When certain inclinations are   found, they are always just and humane. In\nThe Forest\n(1924), for example, he brands the inconsiderate spirit of greed   that, for crass purposes, exploits the heroism of the British   world-conquering mind.\nThe Show\n(1925) represents the   defencelessness of the individual against the press in a family   tragedy where brutal newspaper curiosity functions like a deaf   and unchecked machine, removing the possibility of any one being   held responsible for the resultant evil.\nLoyalties\ndepicts a matter of honour in which loyalty is   tested and impartially examined in the different circles where it   is at work, that is, the family, the corporation, the profession,   and the nation. The force of these and other plays is in their   logical structure and their concentrated action; sometimes they   also possess an atmosphere of poetic feeling that is far from   trivial. I am thinking especially of\nA Pigeon\n(1912) and\nA Bit o’ Love\n(1915) which, however, did not meet with   such brilliant success on the stage. Although on the whole   Galsworthy’s plays cannot be rated artistically with his novels,   they confirm quite as plainly how strongly he sticks to his early   ideal of liberty, that which in Shelley put on the wings and   flames of dawn. Even in his rather cool dramatic works we meet a   steady enemy of all oppression, spiritual as well as material, a   sensitive man who with all his heart reacts against lack of   consideration and never gives way in his demand for fair   play.\nIn technique Turgenev is one of his first teachers. As in the   charming Russian narrator, we find in Galsworthy a definite   musical charm catching and keeping the hidden feelings. His   intuition is so infallible that he can content himself with a   slight allusion and a broken hint. But then there is Galsworthy’s   irony, such a singular instrument that even the tone separates   him from any other writer. There are many different kinds of   irony. One principal kind is negative and can be compared to the   hoar-frost of the windows in a house where there is no fire,   where the hearth has grown cold long ago. But there is also an   irony friendly to life, springing from warmth, interest, and   humanity; such is Galsworthy’s. His is an irony that, in the   presence of tragicomic evil, seems to question why it must be so,   why it is necessary, and whether there is nothing to remedy it.   Sometimes Galsworthy makes nature herself take part in that   ironic play about human beings, to underline the bitterness or   sweetness of the incidents with the help of winds, clouds,   fragrances, and bird cries. Assisted by this irony he   successfully appeals to the psychological imagination, always the   best ally of understanding and sympathy.\nGalsworthy once formulated his artistic motto in words such as   harmony, proportion, balance. They mark his natural turn of mind,   a spiritual ideal, now often suspect, perhaps because it is so   difficult to reach. We soon discover that this poet who so   severely and persistently attacked the typical gentleman of   self-sufficiency, himself indisputably succeeded in filling the   old notion with new life, so that it preserved its contact with   both the immediately human and the unrestricted aesthetic   instinct. In the artist Galsworthy flourish exactly those   qualities of temper that in English are comprehended in this   word:\ngentleness\n. These qualities are expressed in his   works, and in this way they have become a cultural contribution   to our own times.\nAs Mr. Galsworthy has unfortunately been prevented by illness   from being here today, as he had wished, to receive personally   the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1932, it will now be delivered   to the representative of Great Britain here present, Minister   Clark Kerr.\nYour Excellency – May I ask you to receive from His Majesty’s   hands the Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded to your famous   countryman.\nAt the banquet, Gunnar Holmgren, Rector of\nthe Caroline   Institute\n, made these remarks: «Finally, we are today   paying homage to John Galsworthy. If this our homage is marked by   a feeling of very special warmth, it is largely because his noble   personality and his exquisite artistic gifts, as displayed in his   numerous literary works, have long been famous and highly   appreciated all over the world. But the reason is no less to be   found in that spirit of idealism, that warm sympathy and true   humanity that radiate from all his writings and render him   especially worthy to receive a gift from Alfred Nobel’s   Foundation. We regret very deeply that unfortunate circumstances   have prevented John Galsworthy from being present here today. We   should have been happy indeed to have had the privilege at the   same time of honouring in his person the incarnation of that   high-minded and idealistic England which we all love and admire.   I beg to request His Excellency the British Minister kindly to   convey to him our sincere greetings and heartiest   congratulations.»\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

He came from a family of country squires and   grew up in the literary tradition of the times in which that   social class dominated Russian culture, created a literature   occupying a place of honour in contemporary Europe, and led to   fatal political movements. «The lords of the scrupulous   consciences» is what the following generation ironically   called these men who, full of indignation and pity, set   themselves up against the humiliation of the serfs. They deserved   a better name, for they would soon have to pay with their own   prosperity for the upheaval that they were going to cause.\nOnly the debris of the family possessions remained about the   young Bunin; it was in the world of poetry that he could feel a   strong rapport with the past generations. He lived in a world of   illusions without any energy, rather than of national sentiment   and hope for the future. Nonetheless he did not escape the   influence of the reform movement; as a student, he was deeply   struck by the appeal of Tolstoy’s proclaiming fraternity with the   humble and poor. Thus he learned like others to live by the toil   of his hands, and for his part he chose the craft of cooper in   the home of a co-religionist who greatly loved discussion. (He   might well have tried a less difficult craft-the staves come   apart easily, and it takes much skill to make a vessel that will   hold its content.)\nFor a guide in more spiritual doctrines he had a man who fought   with wavering energy against the temptations of the flesh in a   very literal sense, and here vegetarianism entered his doctrine.   During a voyage with him to Tolstoy’s home to be presented to the   master – Bunin was able to observe his victories and defeats. He   was victorious over several refreshment stands in railroad   stations but finally the temptation of the meat pâtés   was too strong. Having finished chewing, he found ingenious   excuses for his particular fall: «I know, however, that it   is not the pâté that holds me in its power but I who   hold it. I am not its slave; I eat when I want to; when I don’t   want to, I don’t eat.» It goes without saying that the young   student did not want to stay long in this company.\nTolstoy himself did not attach great importance to Bunin’s   religious zeal. «You wish to live a simple and industrious   life? That is good, but don’t be priggish about it. One can be an   excellent man in all kinds of lives.» And of the profession   of poet he said, «Oh well, write if you have a great fancy   for it, but remember well that it can never be the goal of your   life.» This warning was lost on Bunin; he was already a poet   with all his being.\nHe quickly attracted attention for verses that followed austere   classical models; their subject was often descriptions of   melancholic beauty of past life in the old manors. At the same   time he developed in prose poems his power to render nature with   all the fullness and richness of his impressions, having   exercised his faculties with an extraordinary subtlety to   reproduce them faithfully. Thus he continued the art of the great   realists while his contemporaries devoted themselves to the   adventures of literary programs: symbolism, neo-naturalism,   Adamism, futurism, and other names of such passing phenomena. He   remained an isolated man in an extremely agitated era.\nWhen Bunin was forty, his novel\nDerévnya\n(1910)   [\nThe Village\n] made him famous and indeed notorious, for   the book provoked a violent discussion. He attacked the essential   point of the Russian faith in the future, the Slavophiles’ dream   of the virtuous and able peasant, through whom the nation must   someday cover the world with its shadow. Bunin replied to this   thesis with an objective description of the real nature of the   peasants’ virtues. The result was one of the most sombre and   cruel works even in Russian literature, where such works are by   no means rare.\nThe author gives no historical explanation of the decadence of   the\nmuzhikí\n, except for the brief information that   the grandfather of the two principal characters in the novel was   deliberately tracked to death by his master’s greyhounds. This   deed expresses well, in fact, the imprint borne by the spirit of   the suppressed. But Bunin shows them just as they are without   hesitating before any horror, and it was easy for him to prove   the truthfulness of his severe judgment. Violence of the most   cruel kind had recently swept the province in the wake of the   first revolution – a foreshadowing of a later one.\nFor lack of another name, the book is called a novel in the   translations but it really bears little resemblance to that   genre. It consists of a series of immensely tumultuous episodes   from lower life; truth of detail has meant everything to the   author. The critic questioned not so much the details but their   disinterested selection – the foreigner cannot judge the validity   of the criticism. Now the book has had a strong revival because   of events since then, and it remains a classic work, the model of   a solid, concentrated, and sure art, in the eyes of the Russian   émigrés as well as of those in the homeland. The   descriptions of villages were continued in many shorter essays,   sometimes devoted to the religious element which, in the eyes of   the enthusiastic national generation, made the\nmuzhikí\nthe people of promise. In the writer’s   pitiless analysis the redemptive piety of the world is reduced to   anarchic instincts and to the taste for self-humiliation,   essential traits of the Russian spirit according to him. He was   indeed far from his youthful Tolstoyian faith. But he had   retained one thing from it: his love of the Russian land. He has   hardly ever painted his marvellous countryside with such great   art as in some of these novellas. It is as if he had done it to   preserve himself, to be able to breathe freely once more after   all he had seen of the ugly and the false.\nIn a quite different spirit\nSukhodól\n(1911-12), the   short novel of a manor, was written as a counterpart to\nDerévnya\n. The book is not a portrayal of the present   times, but of the heyday of the landed proprietors, as remembered   by an old servant in the house where Bunin grew up. The author is   not an optimist in this book, either; these masters have little   vital force, they are as unworthy of being responsible for their   own destinies and those of their subordinates as the severest   accuser could have desired. In effect one finds here in large   measure the materials for that defence of the people which Bunin   silently passed over in\nDerévnya\n.\nBut nonetheless the picture appears now in a totally different   light; it is filled with poetry. This is due in part to the kind   of reconciliation that the past possesses, having paid its debt   by death; but also to the sweet vision of the servant who gives   charm to the confused and changing world in which, however, her   youth was ruined. But the chief source of poetry is the author’s   imaginative power, his faculty for giving this book, with an   intense concentration, the richness of life.\nSukhodól\nis a literary work of\nvery\nhigh order.\nDuring the years which remained before the World War, Bunin made   long trips through the Mediterranean countries and to the Far   East. They provided him with the subjects of a series of exotic   novellas, sometimes inspired by the world of Hindu ideas, with   its peace in the abnegation of life, but more often by the   strongly accentuated contrast between the dreaming Orient and the   harsh and avid materialism of the West. When the war came, these   studies in the spirit of the modern globe-trotters with the   imprint created by the world tragedy were to result in the   novella that came to be his most famous work:\nGospodín iz   San Francisco\n(1916) [\nThe Gentleman from San   Francisco\n].\nAs often elsewhere, Bunin here simplifies the subject extremely   by restricting himself to developing the principal idea with   types rather than complex characters. Here he seems to have a   special reason for this method: it is as if the author were   afraid to come too close to his figures because they awaken his   indignation and his hate. The American multi-millionaire, who   after a life of ceaseless thirst for money, sets out as an old   man into the world to refresh the dry consciousness of his power,   his blindness of soul, and his avidity for senile pleasure,   interests the author only in so far as he can show in what a   pitiable manner he succumbs, like a bursting bubble. It is as if   a judgment of the pitiless world were pronounced against his   character. In place of a portrait of this pitifully insignificant   man, the novella gives by its singularly resolute art a portrait   of destiny, the enemy of this man, without any mysticism but only   with strictly objective description of the game of the forces of   nature with human vanity. The mystical feeling, however, is   awakened in the reader and becomes stronger and greater through   the perfect command of language and tone.\nGospodín iz San   Francisco\nwas immediately accepted as a literary masterpiece;   but it was also something else: the portent of an increasing   world twilight; the condemnation of the essential guilt in the   tragedy; the distortion of human culture which pushed the world   to the same fate.\nThe consequences of the war expelled the author from his country,   so dear to him despite everything, and it seemed a duty to remain   silent under the severe pressure of what he had suffered. But his   lost country lived again doubly dear in his memory, and regret   gave him more pity for men. Still, he sometimes, with stronger   reason, painted his particular enemy, the muzhík, with a   sombre clear-sightedness of all his vices and faults; but   sometimes he looked forward. Under all repellent things, he saw   something of indestructible humanity, which he represented not   with moral stress but as a force of nature, full of the immense   possibilities of life. «A tree of God», one of them   calls himself, «I see thus that God provides it; where the   wind goes, there I follow.» In this manner he has taken   leave of them for the present.\nFrom the inexhaustible treasures of his memories of the Russian   nature, Bunin was later able to draw anew the joy and the desire   to create. He gave colour and brilliance to new Russian   destinies, conceived in the same austerity as in the era when he   lived among them. In Mítina lyubóv (1924-25)   [\nMitya’s Love\n], he analyzed young feelings with all the   mastery of a psychology in which sense impressions and states of   mind, marvellously rendered, are particularly essential. The book   was very successful in his country, although it signalled the   return to literary traditions which, with many other things’ had   seemed condemned to death. In what has been published of\nZhizn   Arsénieva\n(Part I,\nIstóki dnéy\n, 1930   [\nThe Well of Days\n]), partially an autobiography he has   reproduced Russian life in a manner broader than ever before. His   old superiority as the incomparable painter of the vast and rich   beauty of the Russian land remains fully confirmed here.\nIn the literary history of his country, the place of Ivan Bunin   has been clearly defined and his importance recognized for a long   time and almost without divergence of opinions. He has followed   the great tradition of the brilliant era of the nineteenth   century in stressing the line of development which can be   continued. He perfected concentration and richness of expression   – of a description of real life based on an almost unique   precision of observation. With the most rigorous art he has well   resisted all temptations to forget things for the charm of words;   although by nature a lyric poet, he has never embellished what he   has seen but has rendered it with the most exact fidelity. To his   simple language he has added a charm which, according to the   testimonies of his compatriots, has made of it a precious drink   that one can often sense even in the translations. This ability   is his eminent and secret talent, and it gives the imprint of the   masterpiece to his literary work.\nMr. Bunin – I have tried to present a picture of your work and of   that austere art which characterizes it, a picture doubtlessly   quite incomplete because of the little time at my disposal for a   task so demanding.

As an author of novellas he certainly is without equal in output,   even in the primary country of this literary genre. Boccaccio’s\nDecameron\ncontains one hundred novellas; Pirandello’s\nNovelle per un anno\n(1922-37) has one for each day of the   year. They offer much variation in subject matter as well as in   character: descriptions of life either purely realistic or   philosophically profound or paradoxical, as often marked by   humour as by satire. There are also creations of a jaunty poetic   imagination in which the demands of reality give way to an ideal   and creative truth.\nThe common feature of all these novellas is the effortless   improvisation that gives them spontaneity, élan, and life.   But since the limited scope of the novella demands a particularly   strict composition, we also find the result of improvisation. In   his hurried treatment of the subject Pirandello may soon lose   control, without any concern for the overall impression. Although   his novellas reveal much originality, they are hardly   representative of the accomplished master; this is readily   apparent when one notes the many motifs which were later employed   in his dramatic work.\nNor do his novels mark the zenith of his literary achievement.   Although his early novels were imbued with the same ideas with   which he made his profoundly original contribution to the modern   theatre, he reserved the definitive shaping of these ideas for   the theatre.\nIn the short survey that is possible here, we can mention only   one of these novels in which a distinctive feature of his concept   of our times, his disgust and fear of materialism which   mechanizes life, appears most strongly. The novel is\nSi   gira\n(1916) [\nShoot!\n], titled after a technical term of   the cinema, «Shoot one». The expression warns the   actors when the shooting of a scene begins. The narrator is the   one who «shoots», that is, the cameraman of a large   film industry. He finds a special meaning in his work. For him,   life with all its good and evil is reduced to the material of   images mechanically produced for a thoughtless pastime; it has no   other purpose. The photographic apparatus becomes a demon which   swallows everything and unrolls it on the film reel, thus giving   it an outward appearance of reality, an appearance which is, in   essence, spiritual death and emptiness. Our modern existence   revolves and runs with the same lifeless speed, completely   mechanized as if it were destroyed and annihilated. The author’s   attitude is expressed with extreme intensity. The mere plot is   devastating enough.\nThat is the background of Pirandello’s dramas, limited as they   most often are to purely psychological problems. The bitterness   of our present era must have had much influence on the plays’   pessimistic philosophy even if this philosophy is based on the   author’s nature.\nMaschere Nude\n(1918-21), the title he gave to his   collection of plays, is difficult to translate because of its   complexity. Literally this expressions means «naked   masks», but «masks» usually indicates a bare   surface. In this case, however, the word is applied to the   disguise which hides one from others and from one’s self and   which signifies to Pirandello the form of the selfa surface with   an unfathomable being behind it. «Veiled» masks,   analyzed and dissolved with penetrating clarity: this is the   portrayal of human beings in his dramas – men are unmasked. That   is the meaning of the phrase.\nThe most remarkable feature of Pirandello’s art is his almost   magical power to turn psychological analysis into good theatre.   Usually the theatre requires human stereotypes; here the spirit   is like a shadow, obscurity behind obscurity, and one cannot   decide what is more or less central inside. Finally one racks his   brains, for there is no centre. Everything is relative, nothing   can be grasped completely, and yet the plays can sometimes seize,   captivate, and charm even the great international public. This   result is wholly paradoxical. As the author himself explained, it   depends on the fact that his works «arise out of images   taken from life which have passed through a filter of ideas and   which hold me completely captive». It is the image which is   fundamental, not, as many have believed, the abstract idea   disguised afterwards by an image.\nIt has been said that Pirandello has but a «single»,   idea, the illusory nature of the personality, of the   «I». The charge is easy to prove. The author is indeed   obsessed with that idea. However, even if the idea is expanded to   include the relativity of everything man believes he sees and   understands, this charge is unfair.\nPirandello’s dramatic art did not at first break with general   literary tendencies. He treated social and ethical problems, the   conflict between parenthood and the social structure with its   inflexible notions of honour and decency, and the difficulties   that human goodness finds in protecting itself against the same   adversaries. All this was presented in morally as well as   logically complicated situations and ended either in victory or   defeat. These problems had their natural counterpart in the   analysis of the «I» of the characters who were as   relative as the idea against which they were fighting.\nIn several of his plays it is the idea others have of a   personality and the effect they experience from it which becomes   the principal subject. Others know us only as we know them,   imperfectly; and yet we make definitive judgments. It is under   the atmospheric pressure of these judgments that the   consciousness of one’s self can be changed. In\nTutto per   bene\n(1920) [\nAll For The Best\n] this psychological   process is carried to its conclusion. In\nVestire gli   ignudi\n(1923) [\nTo Clothe the Naked\n] the motif is   turned upside down and assumes a moving tragic character. A lost   life, an «I», no longer finding anything in itself,   desires death but, turning entirely to the outside, has a last   pathetic wish to have a proper shroud in the beautifying idea   which others have of its former being. In this gripping play even   Iying appears by its anguish as a kind of innocence.\nBut the author does not stop here; several of his plays deal with   the lie in the world of relativity and examine with a penetrating   logic how more or less criminal this lie is. In\nLa vita che ti   diedi\n(1924) [\nThe Life I Gave You\n] the right to   unreality receives beautiful and great expression. A woman,   having lost her only son, no longer has anything which holds her   to life; yet the very violence of the blow reawakens in her a   strength which dispels death, as light dispels darkness. All has   become shadows; she feels that not only herself but all existence   is «such stuff as dreams are made of». In her heart she   guards both the memory and the dream, and now they are able to   surpass all other things. The son to whom she gave life, who   always filled her soul, fills it still. There no void is   possible; the son cannot be removed. He remains in her presence,   a form she cannot grasp; she feels him there as much as she is   able to feel anything. Thus the relativity of truth has taken the   shape of a simple and sublime mystery.\nThe same relativity appears as an enigma in\nCosì é   (se vipare)\n(1918) [\nRight You Are (If You Think You   Are)\n]. The play is called a parable, which means that its   singular story makes no pretensions to reality. It is a bold and   ingenious fabrication which imparts wisdom. The circumstances of   a family, recently settled in a provincial city, become   intolerable to the other inhabitants of the town. Of the three   members of the family, the husband, the wife, and the   mother-in-law, either the husband or the mother-in-law, each   otherwise reasonable, must be viewed as seized with absurd ideas   about the identity of the wife. The last speaker always has the   final say on the issue, but a comparison of the conflicting   statements leaves it in doubt. The questionings and the   confrontation of the two characters are described with great   dramatic art and with a knowledge of the most subtle maladies of   the soul. The wife should be able to resolve the puzzle, but when   she appears she is veiled like the goddess of knowledge and   speaks mysteriously; to each of the interested parties she   represents what she must be in order for that person to preserve   his image of her. In reality she is the symbol of the truth which   no one can grasp in its entirety.\nThe play is also a brilliant satire on man’s curiosity and false   wisdom; in it Pirandello presents a catalogue of types and   reveals a penetrating self-conceit, either partially or   completely ridiculous, in those attempting to discover truth. The   whole remains a masterpiece in its own right.\nThe central problem in the author’s dramatic work, however, is   the analysis of the «I» – its dissolution in contrary   elements, the negation of its unity as illusory, and the   symbolical description of the\nMaschere nude\n. Thanks to the   inexhaustible productivity of his mind, Pirandello attacks the   problem from different sides, some of which have already been   mentioned.\nBy sounding the depths of madness, he makes important   discoveries. In the tragedy of\nEnrico IV\n(1922) [\nHenry   IV\n], for example, the strongest impression comes from the   struggle of the personality for its identity in the eternally   flowing torrent of time. In\nIl giuoco delle parti\n(19191)   [\nThe Rules of the Game\n] Pirandello creates a drama of pure   abstractions: he uses the artificial notions of duty to which   members of society can be subjected by the force of tradition   with resolute logic for an action completely contrary to   expectation. As by a stroke of a magic wand, the game of   abstractions fills the scene ith an extremely captivating   life.\nSei Personaggi in cerca d’autore\n(1921) [\nSix Characters   in Search of an Author\n] is a game similar to that described   earlier and at the same time its very opposite; it is both   profoundly serious and full of ideas. Here unrestrained creative   imagination rather than abstraction dominates. It is the true   drama of poetic creation; it is also the settling of accounts   between the theatre and truth, between appearance and reality.   Moreover, it is the half-despairing message of art to the soul of   a ravaged age, of fragmentary scenes both fulminating and   explosive. This flood of violent feeling and superior   intellectuality, rich in poetry, is truly the inspiration of   genius. The world-wide success of the play, which proves that it   has to some extent been understood, is as extraordinary as the   piece itself There is neither the necessity nor the time to   recall its magically startling details.\nThe sceptical psychology on which Pirandello has based his   remarkable production is purely negative. If it were adopted by   the general public with the same naiveté with which new and   bold ideas are generally received, it would indeed entail more   than one risk. But there is no danger that this will happen. It   applies itself to purely intellectual realms and the general   public scarcely follows it there. If by chance someone might be   persuaded that his «I» is a fiction, he would soon be   convinced that in practice this «I» does possess a   certain degree of reality. Just as it is impossible to prove the   freedom of the will, which is however constantly proved by   experience, so the «I» manifestly finds means to make   itself remembered. These means are gross or subtle. The most   subtle of them perhaps consists in the faculty of thought itself;   among others, the thought which wants to annihilate the   «I».\nBut the analytical work of this great writer retains its value,   especially if compared to several other things to which we have   been treated in our time. Psychological analysis has given us   complexes, which have spread immense pleasure and joy. They have   even been worshipped as fetishes by apparently pious minds.   Barbarous fetishes! To a person with some visual imagination,   they resemble seaweed entangled in the water. Small fish often   hover before this seaweed meditating until, their heads clear at   last, they sink into it and disappear. Pirandello’s scepticism   protects us from such adventures; furthermore, he can help us. He   warns us not to touch the delicate tissue of the human soul in a   coarsely dogmatic and blind manner.\nAs a moralist, Pirandello is neither paradoxical nor destructive.   Good remains good, and evil, evil. A nobly old-fashioned humanity   dominates his ideas about the world of men. His bitter pessimism   has not stifled his idealism; his penetrating analytical reason   has not cut the roots of life. Happiness does not occupy a large   place in the world of his imagination, but what gives dignity to   life still finds enough air to breathe in it.\nDear Dr. Pirandello – Mine was the difficult task of presenting a   concise synopsis of your profound literary work. Although such a   brief sketch is hardly adequate, I have carried out my charge   with pleasure.\nMay I now ask you to receive from His Majesty the Nobel Prize in   Literature, of which the Swedish Academy has deemed you   worthy.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The legendary   nimbus that gathers around celebrities in his case took the form   of heroic events created out of his background. With his contempt   for publicity, O’Neill straightway put a stop to all such   attempts; there was no glamour to be derived from his drab   hardships and toils. We may indeed conclude that the stern   experiences were not uncongenial to his spirit, tending as they   did to afford release of certain chaotic forces within him.\nHis pessimism was presumably on the one hand an innate trait of   his being, on the other an offshoot of the literary current of   the age, though possibly it is rather to be interpreted as the   reaction of a profound personality to the American optimism of   old tradition. Whatever the source of his pessimism may have   been, however, the line of his development was marked out, and   O’Neill became by degrees the uniquely and fiercely tragic   dramatist that the world has come to know. The conception of life   that he presents is not a product of elaborate thinking, but it   has the genuine stamp of something lived through. It is based   upon an exceedingly intense, one might say, heart-rent,   realization of the austerity of life, side by side with a kind of   rapture at the beauty of human destinies shaped in the struggle   against odds.\nA primitive sense of tragedy, as we see, lacking moral backing   and achieving no inner victory – merely the bricks and mortar for   the temple of tragedy in the grand and ancient style. By his very   primitiveness, however, this modern tragedian has reached the   well-spring of this form of creative art, a naive and simple   belief in fate. At certain stages it has contributed a stream of   pulsating life-blood to his work.\nThat was, however, at a later period. In his earliest dramas   O’Neill was a strict and somewhat arid realist; those works we   may here pass by. Of more moment were a series of one-act plays,   based upon material assembled during his years at sea. They   brought to the theatre something novel, and hence he attracted   attention.\nThose plays were not, however, dramatically notable; properly   speaking, merely short stories couched in dialogue-form; true   works of art, however, of their type, and heart-stirring in their   simple, rugged delineation. In one of them,\nThe Moon of the   Caribbees\n(1918), he attains poetic heights, partly by the   tenderness in depicting the indigence of a sailor’s life with its   naive illusions of joy, and pertly by the artistic background of   the play: dirge-like Negro songs coming from a white coral shore   beneath metallically glittering palms and the great moon of the   Caribbean Sea. Altogether it is a mystical weave of melancholy,   primitive savagery, yearning, lunar effulgence, and oppressive   desolateness.\nThe drama\nAnna Christie\n(1921) achieves its most striking   effect through the description of sailors’ life ashore in and   about waterfront saloons. The first act is O’Neill’s masterpiece   in the domain of strict realism, each character being depicted   with supreme sureness and mastery. The content is the raising of   a fallen Swedish girl to respectable human status by the strong   and wholesome influences of the sea; for once pessimism is left   out of the picture, the play having what is termed a happy   ending.\nWith his drama\nThe Hairy Ape\n(1922), also concerned with   sailors’ lives, O’Neill launches into that expressionism which   sets its stamp upon his «ideadramas». The aim of   expressionism in literature and the plastic arts is difficult to   determine; nor need we discuss it, since for practical purposes a   brief description suffices. It endeavours to produce its effects   by a sort of mathematical method; it may be said to extract the   square root of the complex phenomena of reality, and build with   those abstractions a new world on an enormously magnified scale.   The procedure is an irksome one and can hardly be said to achieve   mathematical exactitude; for a long time, however, it met with   great success throughout the world.\nThe Hairy Ape\nseeks to present on a monumental scale the   rebellious slave of steam power, intoxicated with his force and   with superman ideas. Outwardly he is a relapse to primitive man,   and he presents himself as a kind of beast, suffering from   yearning for genius. The play depicts his tragical discomfiture   and ruin on being brought up against cruel society.\nSubsequently O’Neill devoted himself for a number of years to a   boldly expressionistic treatment of ideas and social questions.   The resulting plays have little connection with real life; the   poet and dreamer isolates himself, becoming absorbed in   feverishly pursued speculation and phantasy.\nThe Emperor Jones\n(1920), as an artistic creation, stands   rather by itself; through it the playwright first secured any   considerable celebrity. The theme embraces the mental breakdown   of a Negro despot who rules over a Negro-populated island in the   West Indies. The despot perishes on the flight from his glory,   hunted in the dead of night by the troll-drums of his pursuers   and by recollections of the past shaping themselves as paralyzing   visions. These memories stretch back beyond his own life to the   dark continent of Africa. Here lies concealed the theory of the   individual’s unconscious inner life being the carrier of the   successive stages in the evolution of the race. As to the   rightness of the theory we need form no opinion; the play takes   so strong a hold upon our nerves and senses that our attention is   entirely absorbed.\nThe «dramas of ideas» proper are too numerous and too   diversified to be included in a brief survey. Their themes derive   from contemporary life or from sagas and legends; all are   metamorphosed by the author’s fancy. They play on emotional   chords all tightly strung, give amazing decorative effects, and   manifest a never-failing dramatic energy. Practically speaking,   everything in human life in the nature of struggle or combat has   here been used as a subject for creative treatment, solutions   being sought for and tried out of the spiritual or mental riddles   presented. One favourite theme is the cleavage of personality   that arises when an individual’s true character is driven in upon   itself by pressure from the world without, having to yield place   to a make-believe character, its own live traits being hidden   behind a mask. The dramatist’s musings are apt to delve so deep   that what he evolves has an urge, like deep-sea fauna, to burst   asunder on being brought into the light of day. The results he   achieves, however, are never without poetry; there is an abundant   flow of passionate, pregnant words. The action, too, yields   evidence in every case of the never-slumbering energy that is one   of O’Neill’s greatest gifts.\nUnderneath O’Neill’s fantastic love of experimenting, however, is   a hint of a yearning to attain the monumental simplicity   characteristic of ancient drama. In his\nDesire Under the   Elms\n(1924) he made an attempt in that irection, drawing his   motif from the New England farming community, hardened in te   progress of generations into a type of Puritanism that had   gradually come to forfeit its idealistic inspiration. The course   embarked upon was to be followed with more success in the   «Electra» trilogy.\nIn between appeared\nA Play; Strange Interlude\n(1928),   which won high praise and became renowned. It is rightly termed   «A Play», for with its broad and loose-knit method of   presentation it cannot be regarded as a tragedy; it would rather   seem most aptly defined as a psychological novel in scenes. To   its subtitle, «Strange Interlude», a direct clue is   given in the course of the play: «Life, the present, is the   strange interlude between the past and what is to come.» The   author tries to make his idea clear, as far as possible, by   resorting to a peculiar device: on the one hand, the characters   speak and reply as the action of the play demands; on the other,   they reveal their real natures and their recollections in the   form of monologues, inaudible to the other characters upon the   stage. Once again, the element of masking!\nRegarded as a psychological novel, up to the point at which it   becomes too improbable for any psychology, the work is very   notable for its wealth of analytical and above all intuitive   acumen, and for the profound insight it displays into the inner   workings of the human spirit. The training bore fruit in the real   tragedy that followed, the author’s grandest work:\nMourning   Becomes Electra\n(1931). Both in the story it unfolds and in   the destiny-charged atmosphere enshrouding it, this play keeps   close to the tradition of the ancient drama, though in both   respects it is adjusted to modern life and to modern lines of   thought. The scene of this tragedy of the modern-time house of   Atreus is laid in the period of the great Civil War, America’s\nIliad\n. That choice lends the drama the clear perspective   of the past and yet provides it with a background of intellectual   life and thought sufficiently close to the present day. The most   remarkable feature in the drama is the way in which the element   of fate has been further developed. It is based upon up-to-date   hypotheses, primarily upon the natural-scientific determinism of   the doctrine of heredity, and also upon the Freudian omniscience   concerning the unconscious, the nightmare dream of perverse   family emotions.\nThese hypotheses are not, as we know, established beyond dispute,   but the all-important point regarding this drama is that its   author has embraced and applied them with unflinching   consistency, constructing upon their foundation a chain of events   as inescapable as if they had been proclaimed by the Sphinx of   Thebes herself; Thereby he has achieved a masterly example of   constructive ability and elaborate motivation of plot, and one   that is surely without a counterpart in the whole range of   latter-day drama. This applies especially to the first two parts   of the trilogy.\nTwo dramas, wholly different and of a new type for O’Neill,   followed. They constitute a characteristic illustration of the   way he has of never resting content with a result achieved, no   matter what success it may have met with. They also gave evidence   of his courage, for in them he launched a challenge to a   considerable section of those whose favourable opinions he had   won, and even to the dictators of those opinions. Though it may   not at the present time be dangerous to defy natural human   feelings and conceptions, it is not by any means free from risk   to prick the sensitive conscience of critics. In\nAh,   Wilderness\n(1933) the esteemed writer of tragedies astonished   his admirers by presenting them with an idyllic middle-class   comedy and carried his audiences with him. In its depiction of   the spiritual life of young people the play contains a good deal   of poetry, while its gayer scenes display unaffected humour and   comedy; it is, moreover, throughout simple and human in its   appeal.\nIn\nDays Without End\n(1934) the dramatist tackled the   problem of religion, one that he had until then touched upon only   superficially, without identifying himself with it, and merely   from the natural scientist’s combative standpoint. In this play   he showed that he had an eye for the irrational, felt the need of   absolute values, and was alive to the danger of spiritual   impoverishment in the empty space that will be all that is left   over the hard and solid world of rationalism. The form the work   took was that of a modern miracle play, and perhaps, as with his   tragedies of fate, the temptation to experiment was of great   importance in its origination. Strictly observing the conventions   of the drama form chosen, he adopted medieval naiveté in his   presentation of the struggle of good against evil, introducing,   however, novel and bold features of stage technique. The   principal character he cleaves into two parts, white and black,   not only inwardly but also corporeally, each half leading its own   independent bodily life – a species of Siamese twins   contradicting each other. The result is a variation upon earlier   experiments. Notwithstanding the risk attendant upon that   venture, the drama is sustained by the author’s rare mastery of   scenic treatment, while in the spokesman of religion, a Catholic   priest, O’Neill has created one of his most lifelike characters.   Whether that circumstance may be interpreted as indicating a   decisive change in his outlook upon life remains to be seen in   the future.\nO’Neill’s dramatic production has been extraordinarily   comprehensive in scope, versatile in character, and abundantly   fruitful in new departures; and still its originator is at a   stage of vigorous development. Yet in essential matters, he   himself has always been the same in the exuberant end   unrestrainably lively play of his imagination, in his   never-wearying delight in giving shape to the ideas, whether   emanating from within or without, that have jostled one another   in the depths of his contemplative nature, and, perhaps first and   foremost, in his possession of a proudly and ruggedly independent   character.\nIn choosing Eugene O’Neill as the recipient of the 1936 Nobel   Prize in Literature, the Swedish Academy can express its   appreciation of his peculiar and rare literary gifts and also   express their homage to his personality in these words: the Prize   has been awarded to him for dramatic works of vital energy,   sincerity, and intensity of feeling, stamped with an original   conception of tragedy.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

It is a vast   work both in the number of its volumes and in its scope. It   represents modern French life by means of a whole gallery of   characters and an analysis of the intellectual currents and the   problems that occupied France during the ten years preceding the   First World War, a gallery as full and an analysis as complete as   the subject of the novel permitted. The work has therefore taken   a form especially characteristic of our era, called the   «roman fleuve» in the country of its origin.\nThe term designates a narrative method that is relatively little   concerned with composition and advances like a river across vast   countries, reflecting everything that is found on its way. The   essence of such a novel, in large as well as small matters,   consists in the exactitude of this reflection rather than in the   harmonious balance of its parts; it has no shape. The river   lingers at will and only rarely does the undercurrent disturb the   smooth flow of its surface.\nOur age can hardly be called calm; on the contrary, the speed of   the machines accelerates the rhythm of life to the point of   agitation. It is strange, therefore, that in such an age the most   popular literary form, the novel, should have developed in a   totally opposite direction, and by so doing have become only the   more popular. Still, if the novel offered us the satisfying world   of fantasy, one could explain this phenomenon in psychological   terms as a sort of poetic compensation for the frustrations of   daily life. But it is precisely the heart-rending anguish of   reality that the novel takes such time to sound and to   emphasize.\nNevertheless, the novel is there, with its boundless substance,   and the reader finds a certain solace in the heightened awareness   which he acquires from the inevitable element of tragedy inherent   in all life. With a kind of heroism, it swallows reality in large   draughts and encourages us to bear even great sufferings with   joy. The reader’s aesthetic demands will be satisfied in isolated   sections of the work which are more condensed and therefore   better suited to call forth his feelings.\nLes Thibault\ndoes not lack such sections.\nThe essential characters of the novel are three members of the   same family: the father and two sons. The father remains in the   background; his passive role, one of weight and massiveness, is   presented by a special technique. The two sons and the countless   secondary characters of the work are presented in a dramatic   manner. Unprepared by anything in the story, we see them before   us, acting and speaking in the present; and we are given a   detailed and complete description of the setting. The reader must   be quick to grasp what he sees and hears, for the capricious and   irregular rhythm of life beats everywhere. He is helped in his   task by the writer’s most perfected tool: the analysis of his   heroes’ thoughts, expressed beyond words, an insight into the   darkness which engenders conscious actions. Martin du Gard goes   even further; he shows how thoughts, feelings, and the will can   be transformed before becoming words and acts. Sometimes exterior   considerations – habit, vanity, or even a simple gaucherie –   alter expressions and personality. This examination, at once   subtle and bold, of the dynamic processes of the soul obviously   constitutes Martin du Gard’s most original and most remarkable   contribution to the art of characterizing human beings. From the   aesthetic point of view, this is not always an advantage, for the   analysis may appear cumbersome when its results do not seem   necessary to the story.\nThis introspective method is used even for the father’s   character, but it is less complicated in his case. His   personality is already clear-cut and complete at the beginning of   the novel, for he belongs to the past. Events of the present no   longer affect him.\nHe is a member of the upper middle class, conscious of his status   and his duties, a faithful servant of the Church and a generous   benefactor of society, full of prudent advice. He really belongs   to a generation before his own, to the France of the July   Monarchy; that is why he is to come into more than one conflict   with the next generation, in particular with his sons. But this   conflict rarely reaches the verbal level, for the old man is too   convinced of his proper worth to engage in discussions. Hence the   perennial theme of the opposition of youth to age is not   specially treated here.\nThe representative of age appears above all in an attitude of   introspection and immutability; he relies heavily and   complacently on all that he thinks wise and just. No word can   influence him. In the isolation of his life, one might see the   whole tragedy of age if he were not himself so completely unaware   of the possibility of such a tragedy.\nHe is characterized rather by comic traits; profounder sentiments   are expressed only at the time of his death, in the face of his   human destiny. This expression is not direct but results from a   strictly objective, concrete description of the long martyrdom of   his agony. It is a moving description despite its minute detail.   Up to now he had been considered only from without, with the   exception of some rare instances when he had revealed what, even   in him, was hidden behind the façade he presented to the   world.\nThe difference between him and his oldest son receives little   emphasis. Antoine Thibault is a doctor. Entirely absorbed by his   profession, his father’s moral and ethical points of view are   entirely alien to him. Morality is replaced in him by an intense   and conscientious devotion to research and to the exercise of his   profession. Master of himself, prudent, tactful, he has not the   least desire for opposition; he has not even time to think of it.   In the novel one witnesses his rapid evolution within prescribed   limits. He is a man ambitious for the future. At first he is   occasionally a little fatuous, but he soon commands respect by   his work.\nAntoine becomes a sympathetic representative of the intellectuals   of his day, full of ideas, without prejudices in his conceptions,   but as a determinist convinced of the inability of the individual   to change whatever the general course of events may be. He is not   a revolutionary.\nQuite different is his brother Jacques, who is several years   younger. The latter is too close to the writer’s heart to suffer   any criticism. He is the hero of the work, and the exterior world   is examined and judged according to his ideals. His father’s   responsibility for his evolution is considerable, but actually   Jacques, by his whole nature, is destined to be a revolutionary.   When the story begins, he is a schoolboy of fourteen in a college   run by priests. Although he dislikes and neglects his studies, he   commands respect by his intelligence. The catastrophe occurs when   he discovers a friend among his schoolmates, and their affection,   at this dangerous period of adolescence, takes an exalted and   seemingly erotic form. Their feelings are betrayed by their   letters, misinterpreted (as, indeed, they are bound to be) by the   priests who intervene with disciplinary measures. The strict   surveillance and the very intrusion into his emotional private   life are an unbearable offense to Jacques. Furthermore, he has to   await his father’s rage, stirred up by this scandal. His revolt   is expressed in action. He carries along his friend in his escape   far from all yokes, those he endured and those he feared in a   hostile and harsh world. He feels that his whole being, in the   grip of romantic poetry and of more dangerous tendencies, is   irreconcilable with the real world. Seeking happiness and   freedom, the two boys leave for Africa, but their visionary   project is destroyed in Marseilles by the efforts of the police   who had been alerted.\nOn his return, his father, in an excess of pedagogic zeal, makes   a psychological mistake; he condemns his son to solitary   confinement in a reformatory founded by himself. The oppression   of this confinement causes Jacques’ indomitable personality to   emerge even stronger and fiercer. The account of this development   is the most moving episode in the work.\nAfter he has been released owing to his brother’s influence,   Jacques is permitted to pursue his studies, his only consolation.   He does brilliantly and is easily accepted by the École   Normale, the supreme goal of all ambitious and talented students   and the open door to all top literary or scientific careers. But   Jacques cannot be attracted by an official career that for him is   only a void and an illusion; he soon sets out for adventure and   reality. Once more the boy escapes to Africa, but this time he   succeeds and he remains absent from the narrative for a long   time.\nHe is seen again when Antoine discovers his residence – in   Switzerland among the revolutionaries – and brings him back to   their father’s deathbed. He arrives too late for a   reconciliation, even if one considered a reconciliation between   these two diametrically opposed concepts of life possible. The   old man does not recognize him, but Jacques feels a deep sorrow,   for he is not one of those people who, obsessed with mankind’s   future happiness, begin by stifling every trace of humanity in   themselves.\nSuch is the outline of Jacques’ inner life as far as it is known.   For the rest he remains rather elusive, as before, but we notice   the author’s great appreciation of his faculties and of his   character.\nWe get to know him fully when the novel approaches its conclusion   and at the same time its height of epic grandeur – in the summer   of 1914 just before the world catastrophe. Jacques is in Geneva,   having left Paris soon after his father’s death in order to   escape the necessity of inheriting a fortune in a society which   he scorns. He belongs to a group of socialist and communist   reformers whose immediate mission is to halt the threat of war by   the revolt of the masses. The description of these agitators is   one of the least successful passages in the book; the overall   impression, whether intended or not, is that these men are not   worthy of their mission.\nBut Jacques’ stature increases in everyone’s eyes when he leaves   Geneva and returns to Paris to accomplish his mission. His   development is moral rather than intellectual; his actions have   no great results, but he saves his soul. The description of the   last days of July in Paris, with Jacques wavering between hope   and despair in this surcharged atmosphere, is a veritable\ntour   de force\nin Martin du Gard’s novelistic achievement. The   history of this period revives, reawakens, as far as the masses’   role is concerned. But, as almost always, the role is not   decisive. The masses are impotent, blind, and in this case even   less familiar than usual with the game of politics that causes   such tragedies. The author himself seems not to be particularly   initiated, but he is tolerant and human, and his description, as   far as it goes, is truthful.\nAgainst the background of this bewildering anxiety there occurs a   brief but highly illuminating episode of a completely different   character. Jacques meets again a young girl with whom he had   almost fallen in love several years before, but from whom he had   run away as he had run away from everything else. This time the   true spark is kindled between them. This fatal love story is one   of the most significant episodes in the novel; it is profoundly   felt and rendered in all its pure beauty precisely because it is   restricted to the dimensions that the breathless flight of days   imposes on the story. It lasts only a short time, but that is   enough to give it a tragic and simple beauty.\nWhen all the political illusions vanish for Jacques at the   declaration of war, he recreates for himself a new illusion, born   of his despair and of is will to sacrifice. Right at the front   lines he tries to ward off the catastrophe by appealing from an   airplane to the two opposing armies, seeking to inspire in them a   common revolt and a desire to overthrow the powers which hold   them captive. Without hesitating he leaves Paris and the woman he   loves.\nThe adventure is stamped with the same schoolboy romanticism and   lack of reality as was his first flight out of the world, but   Jacques nonetheless carries out his plan with his customary   energy. His call for revolution is printed in Switzerland, the   airplane and pilot are ready, the expedition begins. It will not   last long, for he has hardly flown over the battlefield when the   plane crashes and catches fire with its whole load, men and   bundles of paper. Jacques himself falls, a heap of bruised and   burned flesh, among the retreating French troops. All his   perception is restricted to a vague sensation of the bitterness   of defeat and to unbearable and infinite physical torments, which   are finally relieved by the bullet of a compatriot tired of   dragging along this ill-fated person whom he holds to be a spy   anyhow.\nIt is difficult to imagine a bitterer dénouement to a   tragedy or a crueller irony in a defeat. But Martin du Gard did   not direct his irony toward his hero. Perhaps he wanted to show   the brutality and the cruelty of world events as opposed to   idealistic tendencies. His bitterness is certainly justified   here, but the long detailed description of the whole episode   becomes almost intolerable in its scrupulous exactitude.\nJacques Thibault, as we finally get to know him, lives in our   memory as a heroic figure. Without the least grandiloquent   attitude or word, this upright, silent, and reserved man receives   at last the seal of grandeur: grandeur of will and courage.   Whenever the novel centres on him, the writer’s untiring work   achieves persuasive eloquence. After his pointed and sceptical   analysis of the human soul, which almost consumes its object with   its often extreme exactness in detail, through the most minute   realism possible, Martin du Gard finally pays homage to the   idealism of the human spirit.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

She did not turn to it as a literary speciality at all; it   came to her naturally.\n«It is people that have always afforded me my greatest   pleasure and interest», she said, «and as I live among   the Chinese, it has been the Chinese people. When I am asked what   sort of people they are, I cannot answer. They are not this or   that, they are just people. I can no more define them than I can   define my own relatives and kinsmen. I am too near to them and I   have lived too intimately with them for that.»\nShe has been among the people of China in all their vicissitudes,   in good years and in famine years, in the bloody tumults of   revolutions and in the delirium of Utopias. She has associated   with the educated classes and with primordially primitive   peasants, who had hardly seen a Western face before they saw   hers. Often she has been in deadly peril, a stranger who never   thought of herself as a stranger; on the whole, her outlook   retained its profound and warm humanity. With pure objectivity   she has breathed life into her knowledge and given us the peasant   epic which has made her world-famous,\nThe Good Earth\n(1931).\nAs her hero she took a man who led the same existence as his   forefathers had during countless centuries, and who possessed the   same primitive soul. His virtues spring from one single root:   affinity with the earth, which yields its crops in return for a   man’s labours.\nWang Lung is created from the same stuff as the yellow-brown   earth in the fields, and with a kind of pious joy he bestows upon   it every ounce of his energy. The two belong to each other in   origin, and they will become one again with the death he will   meet with tranquility. His work is also a duty done, and thus his   conscience is at rest. Since dishonesty avails nothing in his   pursuits, he has become honest. This is the sum total of his   moral conceptions, and equally few are his religious ones, which   are almost entirely comprehended in the cult of   ancestor-worship.\nHe knows that man’s life is a gleam of light between two   darknesses; from the one behind him runs the chain of forefathers   from father to son, and the chain must not be broken by him, if   he is not to lose his dim hope of survival in a surmised, unknown   region. For then would expire a spark of the life-fire of the   race, which each individual man has to care for.\nAnd thus the story begins with Wang Lung’s marriage and his   dreams of sons in the house. Of his wife, O’Lan, he does not   dream, for – as is proper and fitting – he has never seen her.   She is a slave at the great house in the neighbouring town and   cheap to buy, since she is said to be ugly. For that reason she   has probably been left alone by the young sons of the house, and   to this the bridegroom attaches great value.\nTheir life together is happy, for the wife proves to be an   excellent helpmate, and the children soon make their appearance.   She satisfies all the demands laid upon her, and she has no   claims of her own. Behind her mute eyes is hidden a mute soul.   She is all submission, but wise and prompt in action; a wife also   in her paucity of words, springing from a philosophy of life   learned in a hard school.\nSuccess attends the two. They are able to set aside a little   money, and Wang Lung’s great passion, next to parenthood, his   longing for more ground to cultivate, may now venture forth from   subconsciousness. He is able to buy more fields, and everything   promises happiness and increase.\nThen comes a blow from the hand of fate; a drought descends upon   the district. The good earth is changed into yellow, whirling   dust. By selling land they could avert starvation, but that would   be to bolt and lock the door to the future. Neither of them   wishes to do that, so they set forth in company with the growing   army of beggars to a city in the south, to live on the crumbs   from the rich man’s table.\nO’Lan had made the journey once before in her childhood, when the   end of it was that she was sold to save her parents and   brothers.\nThanks to her experience, they accommodate themselves to the new   life. Wang Lung toils as a beast of burden and the others beg   with an acquired aptitude. Autumn and winter pass. With the   spring, their yearning for their own land and its tilling becomes   unendurable, but they have no money for the journey.\nThen again fate intervenes – as natural a fate in China as   drought and plague and flood. War, which is ever present   somewhere in that great country, and the ways of which are as   inscrutable as those of the powers of the air, stalks across the   city and makes chaos of law and order. The poor plunder the homes   of the rich.\nWang Lung goes with the mob without any definite motives, for his   peasant soul revolts at deeds of violence, but by pure chance a   handful of gold coins is almost forced into his hand. Now he can   go home and begin the spring work on his rain-soaked soil. More   than that, he can buy new fields; he is rich and happy.\nHe becomes still richer, though ultimately not happier, through   the plunder acquired by O’Lan. From her days of slavery she knows   something about hiding places in palaces, and she discovers a   handful of precious stones. She takes them nearly as   unpremeditatedly as a magpie steals glittering things, and hides   them as instinctively. When her husband discovers them in her   bosom, his whole world is transformed. He buys farm after farm.   He becomes the leading man in the district, no longer peasant but   lord, and his character changes colour. Simplicity and harmony   with the earth vanish. In their place comes, slowly but surely, a   curse for the desertion.\nWang Lung no longer has any real peace in his lordly leisure,   with a young concubine in the house and O’Lan pushed into a dark   corner, to die there when she has worn herself out.\nThe sons are not attractive figures. The eldest devotes himself   to an empty life of indulgence, the second is swallowed up by   greed for gold as a merchant and usurer. The youngest becomes one   of the «war lords» who drain the unhappy country.   Around them the Middle Empire is torn asunder in the tumult of   new creation, which has become so agonizing in our days.\nThe trilogy does not carry us so far, however; it concludes with   a sort of reconciliation between the third generation and the   good earth. One of Wang Lung’s grandsons, a man educated in the   West, returns to the family estate and applies the knowledge he   has acquired to the improvement of the conditions of work and   life among the peasants.\nThe rest of the family live without roots in that conflict   between old and new which Pearl Buck has described in other works   – mostly in the tone of tragedy.\nOf the many problems in this novel, the most serious and sombre   one is the position of the Chinese woman. From the very beginning   it is on this point that the writer’s pathos emerges most   strongly, and amid the calm of the epic work it constantly makes   itself felt. An early episode in the work gives the most poignant   expression of what a Chinese woman has been worth since time   immemorial. It is given with impressive emphasis, and also with a   touch of humour which is naturally rare in this book. In a moment   of happiness, with his little first-born son dressed in fine   clothes on his arm, and seeing the future bright before him, Wang   Lung is on the point of breaking into boastful words but   restrains himself in sudden terror. There, under the open sky, he   had almost challenged the invisible spirits and drawn their evil   glances upon himself He tries to avert the menace by hiding his   son under his coat and saying in a loud voice,«What a pity   that our child is a girl, which no one wants, and is pitted with   smallpox into the bargain! Let us pray that it may die!» And   O’Lan joins in the comedy and acquiesces – probably without   thinking at all.\nIn reality the spirits need not waste their glances on a girl   child. Its lot is hard enough in any case. It is Pearl Buck’s   female characters which make the strongest impression. There is   O’Lan with her scanty words, which carry all the more weight. Her   whole life is portrayed in equally scanty but telling   lines.\nQuite a different figure is the chief character in the novel\nThe Mother\n(1934). She is not referred to by any other   designation, as if to indicate that her whole destiny is   expressed in that word. She is, however, vividly individualized,   a brave, energetic, strong character, of a more modern type than   O’Lan’s, perhaps, and without her slave temperament. The husband   soon deserts his home, but she keeps it together for her   children. The whole story ends in sorrow, but not in defeat. The   mother cannot be crushed, not even when her younger son is   beheaded as a revolutionary, and she has to seek a stranger’s   grave to weep by, for he has none. Just then a grandson is born,   and she again has someone to love and sacrifice herself   for.\nThe mother is the most finished of Pearl Buck’s Chinese female   figures, and the book is one of her best. But in character   descriptions and the storyteller’s art she is at her best in the   two biographies of her parents,\nThe Exile\n(1936) and\nFighting Angel\n(1936). These should be called classics in   the fullest sense of the word; they will endure, for they are   full of life. In this respect the models from which the portraits   are drawn are of great significance.\nOne seldom feels any great sense of gratitude for the company   proffered in contemporary novels, and it is gladly forgotten. The   characters have no great wealth of qualities, and the writer puts   forth all his powers to lessen them, often by a persistent   analysis with foregone results.\nHere, however, one encounters two consummate characters, living   unselfish lives of action, free from brooding and vacillation.   They are profoundly unlike each other, and the fact that they are   thrown together in a common struggle in a hard and strange world   often leads to great tragedy-but not to defeat: they stand erect   even to the very last. There is a spirit of heroism in both   stories.\nThe mother, Carie, is richly gifted, brave and warm, of a genuine   nature, harmonious amid ever-straining forces. She is tested to   the utmost in sorrows and dangers; she loses many children   because of the harshness of the conditions of life, and at times   a terrible death threatens her in those troubled times. It is   almost as hard for her to witness the never-ending suffering   around her. She does what she can to mitigate it, and that is not   a little, but no power is sufficient for such a task.\nEven inwardly she passes through a hard and unceasing struggle.   In her calling, and with her nature, she needs more than the   conviction of faith. It is not enough for her that she has   dedicated herself to God; she must also feel that the sacrifice   has been accepted. But the sign of this, for which she begs and   prays, never comes. She is compelled to persist in an untiring   endeavour to find God and to content herself with trying to be   good without divine help.\nHowever, she preserves her spiritual health, her love for the   life which has shown her so much that is terrible, and her eye   for the beauty the world has to offer; she even retains her   happiness and her humour. She resembles a fresh fountain   springing from the heart of life.\nThe daughter tells her story with rare and lively perspicuity.   The biography is precise in regard to the course of events, but   creative imagination plays its part in the various episodes and   in the description of the inner life of the character. Nothing is   falsified, for this imagination is intuitive and true.\nThe language has vivid spontaneity; it is clear and suffused with   a tender and soulful humour. There is, however, a flaw in the   story. The daughter’s devotion to her mother makes it impossible   for her to do justice to her father. In his family life his   limitations were obvious, limitations sharp and at times painful.   As a preacher and soldier of Christ he was without blemish, in   many respects even a great character; but he ought to have lived   his life alone, free of the familial duties he hardly found time   to notice, duties which in any case weighed lightly with him   against his all-absorbing calling. Thus he was of little help to   his wife, and in her biography he could not be fully   understood.\nThis was accomplished, however, in another book, whose title is   the key to his life and being:\nFighting Angel\n. Andrew did   not possess his wife’s richly composite nature; his was narrow   but deep, and as bright as a gleaming sword. He devoted every   thought to his goal of opening the way to salvation for the   heathens. Everything was insignificant compared to that. What   Carie prayed for in vain, communion with God, he possessed wholly   and unshakeably in the firm conceptions of his Biblical faith.   With this faith he walked like a conqueror, further than any   other in the immense heathen country, he endured all hardships   without noticing them, and he encountered threats and dangers in   the same manner. For the poor, blind, strange brown people he   felt tenderness and love. Among them his stern nature broke into   blossom. When he had won their souls to a confession of faith, he   did not doubt the genuineness of the confession; with the naivete   of a child, he accepted it as good. The door to God, always   denied them before, had been opened to them, and to weigh them   and judge them was now in the hands of Him who knows best. They   had been given their possibility of salvation, and for Andrew it   was urgent to give this possibility to all he could reach in that   immense country, where thousands were dying every hour. His   enthusiasm burned, and his work had something of genius in its   magnitude and depth.\nHe strained his forces to the utmost in never-ending action, and   the repose he allowed himself was the mystic’s abandonment to the   infinite amid ardent prayers. The whole of his life was a flame   which rose straight and high, in spite of all storms; it could   not be judged by ordinary conceptions. The daughter, whose   portrait conceals none of his repellent features, maintained pure   reverence before the nobility of the whole. One is profoundly   thankful for both these perfectly executed pictures – each in its   way so rare.\nBy awarding this year’s Prize to Pearl Buck for the notable works   which pave the way to a human sympathy passing over widely   separated racial boundaries and for the studies of human ideals   which are a great and living art of portraiture, the Swedish   Academy feels that it acts in harmony and accord with the aim of   Alfred Nobel’s dreams for the future.\nMrs. Walsh, I have attempted a short survey of your work, indeed   hardly necessary here, where the audience is so well acquainted   with your remarkable books.\nI hope, though, that I have been able to give some idea of their   trend, toward opening a faraway and foreign world to deeper human   insight and sympathy within our Western sphere – a grand and   difficult task, requiring all your idealism and greatheartedness   to fulfil as you have done.\nMay I now ask you to receive from the hands of His Majesty the   King the Nobel Prize in Literature, conferred upon you by the   Swedish Academy.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

These   reasons are very briefly stated on this parchment, but you have   been deprived of the many homages which would have been paid you   at the ceremony of the distribution of the Nobel Prizes.\nThese homages you will find equally in our company, in the   simplicity characteristic of our gatherings, but with the same   warmth as that which you would have received in the festival room   on the day of the ceremony. None of us knows your Finnish   language; we have been able to appreciate your works only in the   translations, but no doubt exists about your mastery as a writer.   This mastery is so great that it appears clearly even in a   foreign attire. Simple, brief, objective, without the least   affectation, your language flows with the clarity of a spring and   reflects what your artist’s eye has seized. You have chosen your   motifs with the greatest delicacy and, one could almost say, with   a sort of timidity before what is immediately beautiful. You wish   to create beauty from what exists in everyday nature, and the   manner in which you can do it often remains your secret. It is   not at the writer’s desk that one sees you work but before the   easel of the watercolourist, and, over your shoulder, one often   accustoms one’s eye to see in a new manner. Sometimes, when   painting spaces and clouds in the light of a summer day, you   forget the fear that you have of a too favourable motif and you   then employ the musical art with the hand of a master. This   characteristic trait, your fondness for the simple and the   typical, you show also in your description of man. This   description takes pleasure in rendering the everyday life of the   peasants, strongly attached to the earth from which it draws its   strength. When it is a question of deeds, you show an equal   mastery, and the effect is produced only with the simplest   means.\nConcerning your most celebrated work, you have said some words   which no one else could have found: «Everything that touches   Silja is generally of a magnificent insignificance.» No   artist can go farther in the desire to remain respectfully   faithful to the reality of things. Thus you have represented your   people, without the least finery.\nAt the present moment, even the name of your country is   significant everywhere. As simple as you see them, your people   find themselves a prey to fateful powers, heroically great in   their indomitable courage, faithful to their duty to the very   end, to the death which they confront without trembling. In our   thanks for what you have given, our thoughts go still further;   they go, with all our admiration and the emotion which grips us,   to your people, to your nation.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Jensen\nPresentation\n- Johannes V. Jensen\nPresentation\nSwedish Academy\n, December 10, 1945\nToday Johannes V. Jensen will receive in   person the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1944, and we are happy   to salute the great Danish writer who since the beginning of the   century has been in the front rank, always active, for a long   time controversial, but universally admired for his vitality.   This child of the dry and windy moors of Jutland has, almost out   of spite, astonished his contemporaries by a remarkably prolific   production. He could well be considered one of the most fertile   Scandinavian writers. He has constructed a vast and imposing   literary\nœuvre\n, comprising the most diverse genres:   epic and lyric, imaginative and realistic works, as well as   historical and philosophical essays, not to mention his   scientific excursions in all directions.\nThis bold iconoclast and stylistic innovator has increasingly   become a patriarchal classic, and in his heart he feels close to   the poetry of the golden age and hopes that one day he will be   counted among the life-giving tutelary spirits of his   nation.\nJohannes V. Jensen has been such a passionate student of   biological and philosophical evolution that he should be amazed   at the singular course of his own development. A conquering   instinct forms the basis of his being. He was a native of   Himmerland, a relatively dry region in western Jutland, and his   impressions of men and things were engraved indelibly on his   consciousness. Later he was to remember those resources that were   hidden beneath the sensations of childhood, the ancient treasure   of family memories. His father, the veterinarian of Farsö,   came from that area, and through his paternal grandfather, the   old weaver of Guldager, Jensen is directly descended from   peasants. Characteristically enough, his first book dealt with   the province of his origin. His incomparable\nHimmerlandshistorier\noffer an original portrait gallery of   primitive and half-savage creatures who are still subject to   ancient fears. The promised land of his childhood, powerful and   alive with the past, is found again in his mature poetry.\nThe first books of Johannes V. Jensen reveal him as a young man   from the provinces; a student of opposition, living in   Copenhagen; an arduous and agitated youth, fighting passionately   against intellectual banality and narrow-mindedness. This native   of Jutland, self-conscious, difficult to approach, but sensitive,   was soon to find his country too narrow. Stifled by the familiar   climate of the Danish isles, he threw himself into exotic   romanticism with the cool passion of a gambler. His travels   across foreign continents for the first time opened to him the   space needed by his restless, unchained imagination. During that   period of his life he sang the praise of technology and   mechanization. Just as his compatriot H. C. Andersen was perhaps   the first to describe the charms of railway travel, Johannes V.   Jensen was the prophet of the marvels of our age, of skyscrapers,   motor cars, and cinemas, which he never tires of praising in his   American novels,\nMadame D’Ora\n(1904) and\nHjulet\n(1905) [The Wheel]. But soon he entered into a new stage of his   development; at the risk of simplifying matters we might say   that, having satisfied his passion for distant travel, he began   to look in time for what he had pursued in space. The same man   who had sung the modern life, with its rapid pace and noisy   machines, has become the spectator of ancient epochs and has   devoted himself to the study of the long, slow periods during   which man first sought adventure.\nThus we come to perhaps his most important creation, the six   volumes combined under the title\nDen lange rejse\n, which   leads us from the ice age to Christopher Columbus. The central   theme or one of the central themes of this work is the universal   mission of the Scandinavian people, from the great migrations and   the Norman invasion to the discovery of America. Jensen considers   Christopher Columbus a descendant of the Lombards, in short a   Nordic man, if not a Jutlander like himself. In this monumental   series appears a legendary figure, Nornagestr. He is not at all   the same person who appears at the court of King Olaf Tryggvason   to tell his stories and die there. According to the Icelandic   saga he was three hundred years old; but Jensen makes him even   older and turns him into a kind of Ahasverus, ubiquitous, always   behind his time, a stranger among the new generations, but   nevertheless younger than they because he lived at a time when   existence itself was young and mankind closer to its origins. The   writer has followed tradition only as far as it was useful to   him. Three prophetesses came to Nornagestr’s mother to see the   child and one of them predicted that he would die as soon as the   candle could no longer burn. Gro, the mother, immediately   extinguished the candle and gave it to the child as an amulet. In   the work of Johannes V. Jensen, Nornagestr sometimes lights it in   foreign lands and whenever he does so a deep abyss of time opens   before him. When he comes to again, seized by the love of life,   he is transported to his country, the fresh and green   Zealand.\nAll legends exist because reason alone cannot clarify experience.   What then is Nornagestr, who plays such an important role in the   epic of the Danish master? Perhaps it is the spirit of the Nordic   people rising from the night like a phantom or like an atavistic   creature. One suspects that this unique globetrotter with his   harp is closely related to the author himself, who has given him   many ideas about life and death, and about the close relation   between the present and eternity – the precious fruits of   experiences gathered from the lands and seas of the globe.\nFor Johannes V. Jensen, who grew up on a Jutland moor where the   horizon is often indented by a line of tumuli, it was natural to   divide his interests between facts and myths and to seek his way   between the shadows of the past and the realities of the present.   His example reveals to us both the attraction of the primitive   for a sensitive man and the necessity of transforming brute force   into tenderness. He has attained the summit of his art by means   of these violent contrasts. A fresh, salty breeze blows through   his work, which unfolds with vivid language, powerful expression,   and singular energy. Precisely in the poets most deeply rooted in   their country do we find this poetic genius for words. Jensen is   the voice of Jutland and of Denmark. With his talents he deserves   the title of the most eminent narrator of the victorious struggle   of the Nordic people against nature, and of the continuity of the   Nordic spirit throughout the ages.\nMr. Jensen – If you have listened to what I have just said you   will certainly think that the few moments I had were much too   short to accomplish the long voyage through your work, and that I   have neglected important aspects of it. It is fortunate for us as   well as for you that a proper presentation is hardly necessary at   all in your case. You are a well-known member of our great family   and as such you are now asked to receive from the hands of our   King the distinction which the Swedish Academy has awarded   you.\nAt the banquet, Professor A.H.T.

It   is said that when\n[Frédéric] Mistral\n, the first   of the two poets bearing the name of the Mediterranean wind, had   written his first verses in French as a young student, his mother   began to shed inexhaustible tears. An ignorant country woman from   Languedoc, she did not understand this distinguished language.   Mistral then wrote\nMirèio\n, recounting the love of the   pretty little peasant for the poor artisan, an epic that exudes   the perfume of the flowering land and ends in cruel death. Thus   the old language of the troubadours became again the language of   poetry. The Nobel Prize of 1904 drew the world’s attention to   this event. Ten years later the poet of\nMirèio\ndied.\nIn that same year, 1914, the year in which the First World War   broke out, a new Mistral appeared at the other end of the world.   At the Floral Games of Santiago de Chile, Gabriela Mistral   obtained the prize with some poems dedicated to a dead man.\nHer story is so well known to the people of South America that,   passed on from country to country, it has become almost a legend.   And now that she as at last come to us, over the crests of the   Cordilleran Andes and across the immensities of the Atlantic, we   may retell it once again.\nIn a small village in the Elquis valley, several decades ago, was   born a future schoolteacher named Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga. Godoy   was her father’s name, Alcayaga her mother’s; both were of Basque   origin. Her father, who had been a schoolteacher, improvised   verses with ease. His talent seems to have been mixed with the   anxiety and the instability common to poets. He left his family   when his daughter, for whom he had made a small garden, was still   a child. Her beautiful mother, who was to live a long time, has   said that sometimes she discovered her lonely little daughter   engaged in intimate conversations with the birds and the flowers   of the garden. According to one version of the legend, she was   expelled from school. Apparently she was considered too stupid   for teaching hours to be wasted on her. Yet she taught herself by   her own methods, educating herself to the extent that she became   a teacher in the small village school of Cantera. There her   destiny was fulfilled at the age of twenty, when a passionate   love arose between her and a railroad employee.\nWe know little of their story. We know only that he betrayed her.   One day in November, 1909, he fatally shot himself in the head.   The young girl was seized with boundless despair. Like Job, she   lifted her cry to the Heaven that had allowed this. From the lost   valley in the barren, scorched mountains of Chile a voice arose,   and far around men heard it. A banal tragedy of everyday life   lost its private character and entered into universal literature.   Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga became Gabriela Mistral. The little   provincial schoolteacher, the young colleague of\nSelma Lagerlöf\nof Mårbacka,   was to become the spiritual queen of Latin America.\nWhen the poems written in memory of the dead man had made known   the name of the new poet, the sombre and passionate poems of   Gabriela Mistral began to spread over all South America. It was   not until 1922, however, that she had her large collection of   poems,\nDesolación\n(Despair), printed in New York. A   mother’s tears burst forth in the middle of the book, in the   fifteenth poem, tears shed for the son of the dead man, a son who   would never be born…\nGabriela Mistral transferred her natural love to the children she   taught. For them she wrote the collections of simple songs and   rounds, collected in Madrid in 1924 under the title\nTernura\n(Tenderness). In her honour, four thousand Mexican   children at one time sang these rounds. Gabriela Mistral became   the poet of motherhood by adoption.\nIn 1938 her third large collection,\nTala\n(a title which   can be translated as «ravage» but which is also the   name of a children’s game), appeared in Buenos Aires for the   benefit of the infant victims of the Spanish Civil War.   Contrasting with the pathos of\nDesolación\n,\nTala\nexpresses the cosmic calm which envelopes the South   American land whose fragrance comes all the way to us. We are   again in the garden of her childhood; I listen again to the   intimate dialogues with nature and common things. There is a   curious mixture of sacred hymn and naive song for children; the   poems on bread and wine, salt, corn, and water – water that can   be offered to thirsty men – celebrate the primordial foods of   human life!…\nFrom her maternal hand this poet gives us a drink which tastes of   the earth and which appease the thirst of the heart. It is drawn   from the spring which ran for Sappho on a Greek island and for   Gabriela Mistral in the valley Elquis, the spring of poetry that   will never dry up.\nMadame Gabriela Mistral – You have indeed made a long voyage to   be received by so short a speech. In the space of a few minutes I   have described to the compatriots of Selma Lagerlöf your   remarkable pilgrimage from the chair of a schoolmistress to the   throne of poetry. In rendering homage to the rich Latin American   literature, we address ourselves today quite specially to its   queen, the poet of\nDesolación\n, who has become the   great singer of sorrow and of motherhood.\nI ask you now to receive from the hands of His Majesty the King   the Nobel Prize in Literature, which the Swedish Academy has   awarded you.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1946\nNobel Prize in Literature 1946\nHermann Hesse\n- Hermann Hesse\nSwedish Academy\nThis year’s Nobel Prize in literature has   been awarded to a writer of German origin who has had wide   critical acclaim and who has created his work regardless of   public favour. The sixty-nine-year-old Hermann Hesse can look   back on a considerable achievement consisting of novels, short   stories, and poems, partly available in Swedish   translation.\nHe escaped from political pressure earlier than other German   writers and, during the First World War, settled in Switzerland   where he acquired citizenship in 1923. It should not be   overlooked, however, that his extraction as well as his personal   connections had always justified Hesse in considering himself as   much Swiss as German. His asylum in a country that was neutral   during the war allowed him to continue his important literary   work in relative quiet, and at present Hesse, together with\nMann\n, is the best representative   of the German cultural heritage in contemporary literature.\nWith Hesse, more than with most writers, one has to know his   personal background to understand the rather surprising   components that make up his personality. He comes from a strictly   pietist Swabian family. His father was a well-known church   historian, his mother the daughter of a missionary. She was of   French descent and was educated in India. It was taken for   granted that Hermann would become a minister, and he was sent to   the seminary at the cloister of Maulbronn. He ran away, became an   apprentice to a watchmaker, and later worked in bookshops in   Tübingen and Basle.\nThe youthful rebellion against the inherited piety that   nonetheless always remained in the depth of his being, was   repeated in a painful inner crisis, when in 1914 as a mature man   and an acknowledged master of regional literature he went new   ways which were far removed from his previous idyllic paths.   There are, briefly, two factors that caused this profound change   in Hesse’s writings.\nThe first was, of course, the World War. When at its beginning he   wanted to speak some words of peace and contemplation to his   agitated colleagues and in his pamphlet used Beethoven’s motto,   «O Freunde, nicht diese Töne», he aroused a storm   of protest. He was savagely attacked by the German press and was   apparently deeply shocked by this experience. He took it as   evidence that the entire civilization of Europe in which he had   so long believed was sick and decaying. Redemption had to come   from beyond the accepted norms, perhaps from the light of the   East, perhaps from the core hidden in anarchic theories of the   resolution of good and evil in a higher unity. Sick and   doubt-ridden, he sought a cure in the psychoanalysis of Freud,   eagerly preached and practised at that time, which left lasting   traces in Hesse’s increasingly bold books of this period.\nThis personal crisis found its magnificent expression in the   fantastical novel\nDer Steppenwolf\n(1927)   [\nSteppenwolf\n], an inspired account of the split in human   nature, the tension between desire and reason in an individual   who is outside the social and moral notions of everyday life. In   this bizarre fable of a man without a home, hunted like a wolf,   plagued by neuroses, Hesse created an incomparable and explosive   book, dangerous and fateful perhaps, but at the same time   liberating by its mixture of sardonic humour and poetry in the   treatment of the theme. Despite the prominence of modern problems   Hesse even here preserves a continuity with the best German   traditions; the writer whom this extremely suggestive story   recalls most is E.T.A. Hoffmann, the master of the\nElixiere   des Teufels\n.\nHesse’s maternal grandfather was the famous Indologist Gundert.   Thus even in his childhood the writer felt drawn to Indian   wisdom. When as a mature man he travelled to the country of his   desire he did not, indeed, solve the riddle of life; but the   influence of Buddhism soon entered his thought, an influence by   no means restricted to\nSiddhartha\n(1922) the beautiful   story of a young Brahman’s search for the meaning of life on   earth.\nHesse’s work combines so many influences from Buddha and St.   Francis to Nietzsche and Dostoevsky that one might suspect that   he is primarily an eclectic experimenter with different   philosophies. But this opinion would be quite wrong. His   sincerity and his seriousness are the foundations of his work and   remain in control even in his treatment of the most extravagant   subjects.\nIn his most accomplished novellas we are confronted both directly   and indirectly with his personality. His style, always admirable,   is as perfect in rebellion and demonic ecstasy as in calm   philosophical speculation. The story of the desperate embezzler   Klein, who flees to Italy to seek there his last chance, and the   marvellously calm description of his late brother Hans in the\nGedenkblätter\n(1937) [Reminiscences] are masterly   examples from different fields of creativity.\nIn Hesse’s more recent work the vast novel\nDas   Glasperlenspiel\n(1943) [\nMagister Ludi\n] occupies a   special position. It is a fantasy about a mysterious intellectual   order, on the same heroic and ascetic level as that of the   Jesuits, based on the exercise of meditation as a kind of   therapy. The novel has an imperious structure in which the   concept of the game and its role in civilization has surprising   parallels with the ingenious study\nHomo ludens\nby the   Dutch scholar Huizinga. Hesse’s attitude is ambiguous. In a   period of collapse it is a precious task to preserve the cultural   tradition. But civilization cannot be permanently kept alive by   turning it into a cult for the few. If it is possible to reduce   the variety of knowledge to an abstract system of formulas, we   have on the one hand proof that civilization rests on an organic   system; on the other, this high knowledge cannot be considered   permanent. It is as fragile and destructible as the glass pearls   themselves, and the child that finds the glittering pearls in the   rubble no longer knows their meaning. A philosophical novel of   this kind easily runs the risk of being called recondite, but   Hesse defended his with a few gentle lines in the motto of the   book, «…then in certain cases and for irresponsible men it   may be that non-existent things can be described more easily and   with less responsibility in words than the existent, and   therefore the reverse applies for pious and scholarly historians;   for nothing destroys description so much as words, and yet there   is nothing more necessary than to place before the eyes of men   certain things the existence of which is neither provable nor   probable, but which, for this very reason, pious and scholarly   men treat to a certain extent as existent in order that they may   be led a step further toward their being and their   becoming.»\nIf Hesse’s reputation as a prose writer varies, there has never   been any doubt about his stature as a poet. Since the death of   Rilke and George he has been the foremost German poet of our   time. He combines exquisite purity of style with moving emotional   warmth, and his musical form is unsurpassed in our time. He   continues the tradition of Goethe, Eichendorf, and Mörike   and renews its poetic magic by a colour peculiar to himself. His   collection of poems,\nTrost der Nacht\n(1929) [The Solace of   Night], mirrors with unusual clarity not only his inner drama,   his healthy and sick hours, and his intense self-examination, but   also his devotion to life, his pleasure in painting, and his   worship of nature. A later collection,\nNeue Gedichte\n(1937) [New Poems], is full of autumnal wisdom and melancholy   experience, and it shows a heightened sensibility in image, mood,   and melody.\nIn a summary introduction it is impossible to do justice to the   many changing qualities which make this writer particularly   attractive to us and which have justly given him a faithful   following. He is a problematic and a confessional poet with the   wealth of the South German mind, which he expresses in a very   individual mixture of freedom and piety. If one overlooked the   passionate tendency to protest, the ever-burning fire that makes   the dreamer a fighter as soon as the matters at stake are sacred   to him, one might call him a romantic poet. In one passage Hesse   says that one must never be content with reality, that one should   neither adore nor worship it, for this low, always disappointing,   and desolate reality cannot be changed except by denying it   through proving our superior strength.\nHesse’s award is more than the confirmation of his fame. It   honours a poetic achievement which presents throughout the image   of a good man in his struggle, following his calling with rare   faithfulness, who in a tragic epoch succeeded in bearing the arms   of true humanism.\nUnfortunately, reasons of health have prevented the poet from   making the journey to Stockholm. In his stead the envoy of the   Swiss Federal Republic will accept the Prize.\nYour Excellency, I ask you now to receive from the hands of His   Majesty the King the Prize awarded by the Swedish Academy to your   countryman, Hermann Hesse.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1947\nNobel Prize in Literature 1947\nAndré Gide\n- André Gide\nSwedish Academy\nOn the first page of the remarkable journal   kept by André Gide for half a century, the author, then   twenty years old, finds himself on the sixth floor of a building   in the Latin Quarter, looking for a meeting place for «The   Symbolists», the group of youths to which he belonged. From   the window he looked at the Seine and Notre Dame during the   sunset of an autumn day and felt like the hero of a Balzac novel,   a Rastignac ready to conquer the city lying at his feet:«And   now, we two!» However, Gide’s ambition was to find long and   twisting paths ahead; nor was it to be contented with easy   victories.\nThe seventy-eight-year-old writer who this day is being honoured   with the award of the Nobel Prize has always been a controversial   figure. From the beginning of his career he put himself in the   first rank of the sowers of spiritual anxiety, but this does not   keep him today from being counted almost everywhere among the   first literary names of France, or from enjoying an influence   that has persisted unabatedly through several generations. His   first works appeared in the 1890’s; his last one dates from the   spring of 1947. A very important period in the spiritual history   of Europe is outlined in his work, constituting a kind of   dramatic foundation to his long life. One may ask why the   importance of this work has only so recently been appreciated at   its true value: the reason is that André Gide belongs   unquestionably to that class of writers whose real evaluation   requires a long perspective and a space adequate for the three   stages of the dialectic process. More than any of his   contemporaries, Gide has been a man of contrasts, a veritable   Proteus of perpetually changing attitudes, working tirelessly at   opposite poles in order to strike flashing sparks. This is why   his work gives the appearance of an uninterrupted dialogue in   which faith constantly struggles against doubt, asceticism   against the love of life, discipline against the need for   freedom. Even his external life has been mobile and changing, and   his famous voyages to the Congo in 1927 and to Soviet Russia in   1935 – to cite only those – are proof enough that he did not want   to be ranked among the peaceful stay-at-homes of   literature.\nGide comes from a Protestant family whose social position   permitted him to follow his vocation freely and to devote greater   attention than most others can afford to the cultivation of his   personality and to his inner development. He described this   family milieu in his famous autobiography whose title\nSi le   grain ne meurt\n(1924) [\nIf It Die…\n] is taken from   St. John’s words about the grain of wheat that must die before   its fruition. Although he has strongly reacted against his   Puritan education, he has nonetheless all his life dwelled on the   fundamental problems of morality and religion, and at times he   has defined with rare purity the message of Christian love,   particularly in his short novel,\nLa Porte étroite\n(1909) [\nStrait Is the Gate\n], which deserves to be compared   with the tragedies of Racine.\nOn the other hand, one finds in André Gide still stronger   manifestations of that famous «immoralism» – a   conception which his adversaries have often misinterpreted. In   reality it designates the free act, the «gratuitous»   act, the liberation from all repressions of conscience, something   analogous to what the American recluse Thoreau expressed,   «The worst thing is being the slave dealer of one’s   soul.» One should always keep in mind that Gide found some   difficulty in presenting as virtue that which is composed of the   absence of generally recognized virtues.\nLes Nourritures   terrestres\n(1897) [\nFruits of the Earth\n] was a youthful   attempt from which he later turned away, and the diverse delights   he enthusiastically sings of evoke for us those beautiful fruits   of southern lands which do not bear keeping. The exhortation   which he addresses to his disciple and reader, «And now,   throw away my book. Leave me!», has been followed first of   all by himself in his later works. But what leaves the strongest   impression, in\nNourritures\nas elsewhere, is the intense   poetry of separation, of return, captured by him in so masterly a   fashion in the flute-song of his prose. One rediscovers it often,   for example in this brief journal entry, written later, near a   mosque at Brusa on one May morning: «Ah! begin anew and on   again afresh! Feel with rapture this exquisite tenderness of the   cells in which emotion filters like milk… Bush of the dense   gardens, rose of purity, indolent rose in the shade of plane   trees, can it be thee thou hast not known my youth? Before? Is it   a memory I dwell in? Is it indeed I who am seated in this little   corner of the mosque, I who breathe and I who love thee? or do I   only dream of loving thee?… If I were indeed real, would this   swallow have stolen so close to me?»\nBehind the strange and incessant shift in perspective that Gide’s   work offers to us, in the novels as well as in the essays, in the   travel diaries, or in the analyses of contemporary events, we   always find the same supple intelligence, the same incorruptible   psychology, expressed in a language which, by the most sober   means, attains a wholly classic limpidity and the most delicate   variety. Without going into the details of the work, let us   mention in this connection the celebrated\nLes Faux   Monnayeurs\n(1926) [\nThe Counterfeiters\n], with its bold   and penetrating analysis of a group of young French people.   Through the novelty of its technique, this novel has inspired a   whole new orientation in the contemporary art of the narrative.   Next to it, put the volume of memoirs already mentioned, in which   the author intended to recount his life truthfully without adding   anything that could be to his advantage or hiding what would be   unpleasant. Rousseau had had the same intention, with this   difference, that Rousseau exhibits his faults in the conviction   that all men being as evil as he, none will dare to judge or   condemn him. Gide, however, quite simply refuses to admit to his   fellows the right to pass any judgment on him; he calls on a   higher tribunal, a vaster perspective, in which he will present   himself before the sovereign eye of God. The significance of   these memoirs thus is indicated in the mysterious Biblical   quotation of the grain of wheat which here represents the   personality: as long as the latter is sentient, deliberate, and   egocentric, it dwells alone and without germinating power; it is   only at the price of its death and its transmutation that it will   acquire life and be able to bear fruit. «I do not   think,» Gide writes, «that there is a way of looking at   the moral and religious question or of acting in the face of it   that I have not known and made my own at some moment in my life.   In truth, I have wished to reconcile them all, the most diverse   points of view, by excluding nothing and by being ready to   entrust to Christ the solution of the contest between Dionysus   and Apollo.»\nSuch a statement throws light on the intellectual versatility for   which Gide is often blamed and misunderstood, but which has never   led him to betray himself. His philosophy has a tendency toward   regeneration at any price and does not fail to evoke the   miraculous phoenix which out of its nest of flames hurls itself   to a new flight.\nIn circumstances like those of today, in which, filled with   admiring gratitude, we linger before the rich motifs and the   essential themes of this work, it is natural that we pass over   the critical reservations which the author himself seems to enjoy   provoking. For even in his ripe age, Gide has never argued in   favor of a full and complete acceptance of his experiences and   his conclusions. What he wishes above all is to stir up and   present the problems. Even in the future, his influence will   doubtless be noted less in a total acceptance than in a lively   controversy about his work. And in this lies the foundation of   his true greatness.\nHis work contains pages which provoke like a defiance through the   almost unequalled audacity of the confession. He wishes to combat   the Pharisees, but it is difficult, in the struggle, to avoid   shocking certain rather delicate norms of human character. One   must always remember that this manner of acting is a form of the   impassioned love of truth which, since Montaigne and Rousseau,   has been an axiom of French literature. Through all the phases of   his evolution, Gide has appeared as a true defender of literary   integrity, founded on the personality’s right and duty to present   all its problems resolutely and honestly. From this point of   view, his long and varied activity, stimulated in so many ways,   unquestionably represents an idealistic value.\nSince Mr. André Gide, who has declared with great gratitude   his acceptance of the distinction offered him, has unfortunately   been prevented from coming here by reasons of health, his Prize   will now be handed to His Excellency the French Ambassador.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1948\nNobel Prize in Literature 1948\nT.S. Eliot\n- T.S. Eliot\nSwedish Academy\nIn the impressive succession of Nobel Prize   winners in Literature, T.S. Eliot marks a departure from the type   of writer that has most frequently gained that distinction. The   majority have been representatives of a literature which seeks   its natural contacts in the public consciousness, and which, to   attain this goal, avails itself of the media lying more or less   ready at hand. This year’s Prize winner has chosen to take   another path. His career is remarkable in that, from an extremely   exclusive and consciously isolated position, he has gradually   come to exercise a very far-reaching influence. At the outset he   appeared to address himself to but a small circle of initiates,   but this circle slowly widened, without his appearing to will it   himself. Thus in Eliot’s verse and prose there was quite a   special accent, which compelled attention just in our own time, a   capacity to cut into the consciousness of our generation with the   sharpness of a diamond.\nIn one of his essays Eliot himself has advanced, as a purely   objective and quite uncategorical assumption, that poets in our   present civilization have to be difficult to approach. «Our   civilization», he says, «comprehends great variety and   complexity, and this variety and complexity, playing upon a   refined sensibility, must produce various and complex results.   The poet must become more and more comprehensive, more allusive,   more indirect, in order to force, to dislocate if necessary,   language into his meaning.»\nAgainst the background of such a pronouncement, we may test his   results and learn to understand the importance of his   contribution. The effort is worth-while. Eliot first gained his   reputation as the result of his magnificent experiment in poetry,\nThe Waste Land\n, which appeared in 1922 and then seemed   bewildering in several ways, due to its complicated symbolic   language, its mosaic-like technique, and its apparatus of erudite   allusion. It may be recalled that this work appeared in the same   year as another pioneer work, which had a still more sensational   effect on modern literature, the much discussed\nUlysses\n,   from the hand of an Irishman, James Joyce. The parallel is by no   means fortuitous, for these products of the nineteen-twenties are   closely akin to one another, in both spirit and mode of   composition.\nThe Waste Land\n– a title whose terrifying import no one   can help feeling, when the difficult and masterly word-pattern   has finally yielded up its secrets. The melancholy and sombre   rhapsody aims at describing the aridity and impotence of modern   civilization, in a series of sometimes realistic and sometimes   mythological episodes, whose perspectives impinge on each other   with an indescribable total effect. The cycle of poems consists   of 436 lines, but actually it contains more than a packed novel   of as many pages.\nThe Waste Land\nnow lies a quarter of a   century back in time, but unfortunately it has proved that its   catastrophic visions still have undiminished actuality in the   shadow of the atomic age.\nSince then Eliot has passed on to a series of poetic creations of   the same brilliant concentration, in pursuance of the agonized,   salvation-seeking main theme. The\nhorror vacui\nof modern   man in a secularized world, without order, meaning, or beauty,   here stands out with poignant sincerity. In his latest work,\nFour Quartets\n(1943), Eliot has arrived at a meditative   music of words, with almost liturgical refrains and fine, exact   expressions of his spiritual experiences. The transcendental   superstructure rises ever clearer in his world picture. At the   same time a manifest striving after a positive, guiding message   emerges in his dramatic art, especially in the mighty historical   play about Thomas of Canterbury,\nMurder in the Cathedral\n(1935), but also in\nThe Family Reunion\n(1939), which is a   bold attempt to combine such different conceptions as the   Christian dogma of original sin and the classical Greek myths of   fate, in an entirely modern environment, with the scene laid in a   country house in northern England.\nThe purely poetical part of Eliot’s work is not quantitatively   great, but as it now stands out against the horizon, it rises   from the ocean like a rocky peak and indisputably forms a   landmark, sometimes assuming the mystic contours of a cathedral.   It is poetry impressed with the stamp of strict responsibility   and extraordinary self-discipline, remote from all emotional   clichés, concentrated entirely on essential things, stark,   granitic, and unadorned, but from time to time illuminated by a   sudden ray from the timeless space of miracles and   revelations.\nInsight into Eliot must always present certain problems to be   overcome, obstacles which are at the same time stimulating. It   may appear to be contradictory to say that this radical pioneer   of form, the initiator of a whole revolution in style within   present-day poetry, is at the same time a coldly reasoning,   logically subtle theorist, who never wearies of defending   historical perspectives and the necessity of fixed norms for our   existence. As early as the 1940’s, he had become a convinced   supporter of the Anglican Church in religion and of classicism in   literature. In view of this philosophy of life, which implies a   consistent return to ideals standardized by age, it might seem   that his modernistic practice would dash with his traditional   theory. But this is hardly the case. Rather, in his capacity as   an author, he has uninterruptedly and with varying success worked   to bridge this chasm, the existence of which he must be fully and   perhaps painfully conscious. His earliest poetry, so convulsively   disintegrated, so studiously aggressive in its whole technical   form, can finally also be apprehended as a negative expression of   a mentality which aims at higher and purer realities and must   first free itsef of abhorrence and cynicism. In other words, his   revolt is that of the Christian poet. It should also be observed   in this connection that, on the whole, Eliot is careful not to   magnify the power of poetry in relation to that of religion. In   one place, where he wishes to point out what poetry can really   accomplish for our inner life, he does so with great caution and   reserve: «It may make us from time to time a little more   aware of the deeper, unnamed feelings which form the substratum   of our being, to which we rarely penetrate; for our lives are   mostly a constant evasion of ourselves.»\nThus, if it can be said with some justification that Eliot’s   philosophical position is based on nothing but tradition, it   ought nevertheless to be borne in mind that he constantly points   out how generally that word has been misused in today’s debates.   The word «tradition» itself implies movement, something   which cannot be static, something which is constantly handed on   and assimilated. In the poetic tradition, too, this living   principle prevails. The existing monuments of literature form an   idealistic order, but this is slightly modified every time a new   work is added to the series. Proportions and values are   unceasingly changing. Just as the old directs the new, this in   its turn directs the old, and the poet who realizes this must   also realize the scope of his difficulties and his   responsibility.\nExternally, too, the now sixty-year-old Eliot has also returned   to Europe, the ancient and storm-tossed, but still venerable,   home of cultural traditions. Born an American, he comes from one   of the Puritan families who emigrated from England at the end of   the seventeenth century. His years of study as a young man at the   Sorbonne, at Marburg, and at Oxford, clearly   revealed to him that at bottom he felt akin to the historical   milieu of the Old World, and since 1927 Mr. Eliot has been a   British subject.\nIt is not possible in this presentation to indicate more than the   most immediate fascinating features in the complicated   multiplicity of Eliot’s characteristics as a writer. The   predominating one is the high, philosophically schooled   intelligence, which has succeeded in enlisting in its service   both imagination and learning, both sensitivity and the analysis   of ideas. His capacity for stimulating a reconsideration of   pressing questions within intellectual and aesthetic opinion is   also extraordinary, and however much the appraisement may vary,   it can never be denied that in his period he has been an eminent   poser of questions, with a masterly gift for finding the apt   wording, both in the language of poetry and in the defence of   ideas in essay form.\nNor is it due only to chance that he has written one of the   finest studies of Dante’s work and personality. In his bitter   moral pathos, in his metaphysical line of thought, and in his   burning longing for a world order inspired by religion, a\ncivitas dei\n, Eliot has indeed certain points of contact   with the great Florentine poet. It redounds to his honour that,   amidst the varied conditions of his milieu, he can be justly   characterized as one of Dante’s latest-born successors. In his   message we hear solemn echoes from other times, but that message   does not by any means therefore become less real when it is given   to our own time and to us who are now living.\nMr. Eliot – According to the diploma, the award is made chiefly   in appreciation of your remarkable achievements as a pioneer   within modern poetry. I have here tried to give a brief survey of   this very important work of yours, which is admired by many   ardent readers in this country.\nExactly twenty-five years ago, there stood where you are now   standing another famous poet who wrote in the English tongue,\nWilliam Butler Yeats\n.

Faulkner’s Värmland is the northern part of the state of   Mississippi and his Vadköping is called Jefferson. The   parallelism between him and our two fellow countrymen could be   extended and deepened, but time does not allow such excursions   now. The difference – the great difference – between him and them   is that Faulkner’s setting is so much darker and more bloody than   that against which Lagerlöf’s cavaliers and Bergman’s   bizarre figures lived. Faulkner is the great epic writer of the   southern states with all their background: a glorious past built   upon cheap Negro slave labour; a civil war and a defeat which   destroyed the economic basis necessary for the then existing   social structure; a long drawn-out and painful interim of   resentment; and, finally, an industrial and commercial future   whose mechanization and standardization of life are strange and   hostile to the Southerner and to which he has only gradually been   able and willing to adapt himself Faulkner’s novels are a   continuous and ever-deepening description of this painful   process, which he knows intimately and feels intensely, coming as   he does from a family which was forced to swallow the bitter   fruits of defeat right down to their worm-eaten cores:   impoverishment, decay, degeneration in its many varied forms. He   has been called a reactionary. But even if this term is to some   extent justified, it is balanced by the feeling of guilt which   becomes clearer and dearer in the dark fabric at which he labours   so untiringly. The price of the gentlemanly environment, the   chivalry, the courage, and the often extreme individualism was   inhumanity. Briefly, Faulkner’s dilemma might be expressed thus:   he mourns for and, as a writer, exaggerates a way of life which   he himself, with his sense of justice and humanity, would never   be able to stomach. It is this that makes his regionalism   universal. Four bloody years of war brought about the changes in   the social structure which it has taken the peoples of Europe,   except the Russians, a century and a half to undergo.\nIt is against a background of war and violence that the   fifty-two-year-old writer sets his more important novels. His   grandfather held a high command during the Civil War. He himself   grew up in the atmosphere created by warlike feats and by the   bitterness and the poverty resulting from the never admitted   defeat. When he was twenty he entered the Canadian Royal Air   Force, crashed twice, and returned home, not as a military   hero but as a physically and psychically war-damaged youth with   dubious prospects, who for some years faced a precarious   existence. He had joined the war because, as his\nalter ego\nexpressed it in one of his early novels, «one doesn’t want   to waste a war». But out of the youth who once had been   thirsting for sensation and battle, there gradually developed a   man whose loathing of violence is expressed more and more   passionately and might well be summed up by the Fifth   Commandment: Thou shalt not kill. On the other hand, there are   things which man must always show himself unwilling to bear:   «Some things», says one of his latest characters,   «you must always be unable to bear. Injustice and outrage   and dishonor and shame. Not for kudos and not for cash – Just   refuse to bear them.» 0ne might ask how these two maxims can   be reconciled or how Faulkner himself envisages a reconciliation   between them in times of international lawlessness. It is a   question which he leaves open.\nThe fact is that, as a writer, Faulkner is no more interested in   solving problems than he is tempted to indulge in sociological   comments on the sudden changes in the economic position of the   southern states. The defeat and the consequences of defeat are   merely the soil out of which his epics grow. He is not fascinated   by men as a community but by man in the community, the individual   as a final unity in himself, curiously unmoved by external   conditions. The tragedies of these individuals have nothing in   common with Greek tragedy: they are led to their inexorable end   by passions caused by inheritance, traditions, and environment,   passions which are expressed either in a sudden outburst or in a   slow liberation from perhaps generations-old restrictions. With   almost every new work Faulkner penetrates deeper into the human   psyche, into man’s greatness and powers of self-sacrifice, lust   for power, cupidity, spiritual poverty, narrow-mindedness,   burlesque obstinacy, anguish, terror, and degenerate aberrations.   As a probing psychologist he is the unrivalled master among all   living British and American novelists. Neither do any of his   colleagues possess his fantastic imaginative powers and his   ability to create characters. His subhuman and superhuman   figures, tragic or comic in a macabre way, emerge from his mind   with a reality that few existing people – even those nearest to   us – can give us, and they move in a milieu whose odours of   subtropical plants, ladies’ perfumes, Negro sweat, and the smell   of horses and mules penetrate immediately even into a   Scandinavian’s warm and cosy den. As a painter of landscapes he   has the hunter’s intimate knowledge of his own hunting-ground,   the topographer’s accuracy, and the impressionist’s sensitivity.   Moreover – side by side with Joyce and perhaps even more so –   Faulkner is the great experimentalist among twentieth-century   novelists. Scarcely two of his novels are similar technically. It   seems as if by this continuous renewal he wanted to achieve the   increased breadth which his limited world, both in geography and   in subject matter, cannot give him. The same desire to experiment   is shown in his mastery, unrivalled among modern British and   American novelists, of the richness of the English language, a   richness derived from its different linguistic elements and the   periodic changes in style – from the spirit of the Elizabethans   down to the scanty but expressive vocabulary of the Negroes of   the southern states. Nor has anyone since Meredith – except   perhaps Joyce – succeeded in framing sentences as infinite and   powerful as Atlantic rollers. At the same time, few writers of   his own age can rival him in giving a chain of events in a series   of short sentences, each of which is like a blow of a hammer,   driving the nail into the plank up to the head and securing it   immovably. His perfect command over the resources of the language   can – and often does – lead him to pile up words and associations   which try the reader’s patience in an exciting or complicated   story. But this profusion has nothing to do with literary   flamboyance. Nor does it merely bear witness to the abounding   agility of his imagination; in all their richness, every new   attribute, every new association is intended to dig deeper into   the reality which his imaginative power conjures up.\nFaulkner has often been described as a determinist. He himself,   however, has never claimed to adhere to any special philosophy of   life. Briefly, his view of life may perhaps be summed up in his   own words: that the whole thing (perhaps?) signifies nothing. If   this were not the case, He or They who set up the whole fabric   would have arranged things differently. And yet it must mean   something, because man continues to struggle and must continue to   struggle until, one day, it is all over. But Faulkner has one   belief, or rather one hope: that every man sooner or later   receives the punishment he deserves and that self-sacrifice not   only brings with it personal happiness but also adds to the sum   total of the good deeds of mankind. It is a hope, the latter part   of which reminds us of the firm conviction expressed by the   Swedish poet Viktor Rydberg in the recitative of the Cantata   presented at the Jubilee Degree Conferment at Uppsala in   1877.\nMr. Faulkner – The name of the southern state in which you were   born and reared has long been well known to us Swedes, thanks to   two of the closest and dearest friends of your boyhood, Tom   Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Mark Twain put the Mississippi River   on the literary map. Fifty years later you began a series of   novels with which you created out of the state of Mississippi one   of the landmarks of twentieth-century world literature; novels   which with their ever-varying form, their ever-deeper and more   intense psychological insight, and their monumental characters –   both good and evil – occupy a unique place in modern American and   British fiction.\nMr. Faulkner – It is now my privilege to ask you to receive from   the hands of His Majesty the King the Nobel Prize in Literature,   which the Swedish Academy has awarded you.\nAt the banquet, Robin Fåhraeus, Member   of the\nRoyal Academy   of Sciences\n, addressed the American author: «Mr. William   Faulkner – We heard with great pleasure that you were coming to   our country to receive your Prize in person.

In one place, speaking of the pre-Socratic   philosophers, he says, «In studying a philosopher, the right   attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of   hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels   like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the   critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the   state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has   hitherto held.»\nAnd in another place in the same work he writes, «It is not   good either to forget the questions that philosophy asks, or to   persuade ourselves that we have found indubitable answers to   them. To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without   being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that   philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study   it.»\nWith his superior intellect, Russell has, throughout half a   century, been at the centre of public debate, watchful and always   ready for battle, as active as ever to this very day, having   behind him a life of writing of most imposing scope. His works in   the sciences concerned with human knowledge and mathematical   logic are epoch-making and have been compared to Newton’s   fundamental results in mechanics. Yet it is not these   achievements in special branches of science that the Nobel Prize   is primarily meant to recognize. What is important, from our   point of view, is that Russell has so extensively addressed his   books to a public of laymen, and, in doing so, has been so   eminently successful in keeping alive the interest in general   philosophy.\nHis whole life’s work is a stimulating defence of the reality of   common sense. As a philosopher he pursues the line from the   classical English empiricism, from Locke and Hume. His attitude   toward the idealistic dogmas is a most independent one and quite   frequently one of opposition. The great philosophical systems   evolved on the Continent he regards, so to speak, from the   chilly, windswept, and distinctive perspective of the English   Channel. With his keen and sound good sense, his clear style, and   his wit in the midst of seriousness, he has in his work evinced   those characteristics which are found among only the elite of   authors. Time does not permit even the briefest survey of his   works in this area, which are fascinating also from a purely   literary point of view. It may suffice to mention such books as   the\nHistory of Western Philosophy\n(1946),\nHuman   Knowledge\n(1948),\nSceptical Essays\n(1948), and the   sketch «My Mental Development» (in\nThe Philosophy of   Bertrand Russell\n, 1951); but to these should be added a great   number of equally important books on practically all the problems   which the present development of society involves.\nRussell’s views and opinions have been influenced by varied   factors and cannot easily be summarized. His famous family   typifies the Whig tradition in English politics. His grandfather   was the Victorian statesman, John Russell. Familiar from an early   age with the ideas of Liberalism, he was soon confronted by the   problems of rising socialism and since then he has, as an   independent critic, weighed the advantages and disadvantages of   this form of society. He has consistently and earnestly warned us   of the dangers of the new bureaucracy. He has defended the right   of the individual against collectivism, and he views industrial   civilization as a growing threat to humanity’s chances of simple   happiness and joy in living. After his visit to the Soviet Union   in 1920 he strongly and resolutely opposed himself to Communism.   On the other hand, during a subsequent journey in China, he was   very much attracted by the calm and peaceable frame of mind of   China’s cultivated classes and recommended it as an example to a   West ravaged by wild aggression.\nMuch in Russell’s writings excites protest. Unlike many other   philosophers, he regards this as one of the natural and urgent   tasks of an author. Of course, his rationalism does not solve all   troublesome problems and cannot be used as a panacea, even if the   philosopher willingly writes out the prescription. Unfortunately,   there are – and obviously always will be – obscure forces which   evade intellectual analysis and refuse to submit to control.   Thus, even if Russell’s work has, from a purely practical point   of view, met with but little success in an age which has seen two   world wars – even if it may look as if, in the main, his ideas   have been bitterly repudiated – we must nevertheless admire the   unwavering valour of this rebellious teller of the truth and the   sort of dry, fiery strength and gay buoyancy with which he   presents his convictions, which are never dictated by opportunism   but are often directly unpopular. To read the philosopher Russell   often gives very much the same pleasure as to listen to the   outspoken hero in a\nShaw\ncomedy,   when in loud and cheerful tones he throws out his bold retorts   and keen arguments.\nIn conclusion, Russell’s philosophy may be said in the best sense   to fulfil just those desires and intentions that Alfred Nobel had   in mind when he instituted his Prizes. There are quite striking   similarities between their outlooks on life. Both of them are at   the same time sceptics and utopians, both take a gloomy view of   the contemporary world, yet both hold fast to a belief in the   possibility of achieving logical standards for human behaviour.   The Swedish Academy believes that it acts in the spirit of   Nobel’s intention when, on the occasion of the fiftieth   anniversary of the Foundation, it wishes to honour Bertrand   Russell as one of our time’s brilliant spokesmen of rationality   and humanity, as a fearless champion of free speech and free   thought in the West.\nMy lord – Exactly two hundred years ago Jean Jacques Rousseau was   awarded the prize offered by the Academy of Dijon   for his famous answer to the question of «whether the arts   and sciences have contributed to improve morals.» Rousseau   answered «No», and this answer – which may not have   been a very serious one – in any case had most serious   consequences. The Academy of Dijon had no revolutionary aims.   This is true also of the Swedish Academy, which has now chosen to   reward you for your philosophical works just because they are   undoubtedly of service to moral civilization and, in addition,   most eminently answer to the spirit of Nobel’s intentions. We   honour you as a brilliant champion of humanity and free thought,   and it is a pleasure for us to see you here on the occasion of   the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Foundation. With these   words I request you to receive from the hands of His Majesty the   King the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1950.\nAt the banquet, Robin Fåhraeus, Member   of the\nRoyal Academy   of Sciences\n, made the following comment: «Dear Professor   Bertrand Russell – We salute you as one of the greatest and most   influential thinkers of our age, endowed with just those four   characteristics which on another occasion you have regarded to be   the criteria of prominent fellow men; namely, vitality, courage,   receptivity, and intelligence.»\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1951\nNobel Prize in Literature 1951\nPär Lagerkvist\n- Pär Lagerkvist\nSwedish Academy\nIn a youthful manifesto of 1913 entitled\nOrdkonst och bildkonst\n[Verbal Art and Pictorial Art],   Pär Lagerkvist, whose name was then unknown, had the   audacity to find fault with the decadence of the literature of   his time which, according to him, did not answer the requirements   of art. His essay contains declarations which in their far too   categorial form border on truism, but which in the light of his   later work take on another, more profound meaning. Thus the young   writer declared, «The writer’s mission is to explain his   time from an artist’s point of view and to express the thought   and feeling of this time for us and generations to come.»   Today we can affirm that Lagerkvist himself, as far as one can   follow him in his ascent toward maturity and greatness, amply   accomplished this goal.\nToday we call attention to this Swedish writer, not to present   him in a general fashion – which would indeed seem superfluous –   but to render to his work and to his person the homage due to   them. Our attention is drawn above all to the impassioned,   unfaltering sincerity, the ardent, unwearying patience, that have   been the living forces behind his work. By these purely spiritual   qualities, Pär Lagerkvist should answer fairly well, at   least as a type of creative mind, to what Nobel said in the   Sibylline terms of his will: «in an idealistic sense».   Undeniably he belongs to that group of writers who, boldly and   directly, have dedicated themselves to the vital questions of   humanity, and who have tirelessly returned to the fundamental   problems of our existence, with all that is overwhelming and   sorrowful. The era in which he lived, whose materials determined   his vocation, was menaced by rising clouds and by the eruptions   of catastrophes. It is on this sombre and chaotic scene that he   began to fight; it is in this country without sun that he   discovered the flame of his inspiration.\nLagerkvist, with a precocious instinct of the imagination,   apprehended the approaching disaster so far in advance that he   was the prophet of anguish in Nordic literature; but he is also   one of the most vigilant guardians of the spirit’s sacred fire   which threatens to be extinguished in the storm. A number of   those listening to me surely recall the short story in   Lagerkvist’s\nOnda Sagor\n(1924) [Evil Tales], in which one   sees the child of ten, on a luminous spring day, walking with his   father along the railroad track; they hear together the songs of   the birds in the forest, and then, on their way back, in the   dusk, they are suddenly surprised by the unknown noise which   cleaves the air. «I had an obscure foreboding of what that   meant; it was the anguish which was going to come, all the   unknown, which Father did not know, and from which he could not   protect me. Here is what this world will be, what this life will   be for me, not like Father’s life in which everything was   reassuring and well established. It was not a real world, not a   real life. It was only something ablaze which rushed into the   depths of obscurity, obscurity without end.» This childhood   memory now appears to us as a symbol of the theme that dominates   Pär Lagerkvist’s work; at the same time, one might say that   it proves to us that his subsequent works are authentic and   logically necessary.\nIt is impossible, with the short time at our disposal today, to   examine all these works in turn. The important thing is that,   while Pär Lagerkvist makes use of different genres, dramatic   or lyric, epic or satiric, his way of grasping reality remains   fundamentally the same. It does not matter in his case if the   results are not always on a level with the intentions, for each   work plays the role of a stone in an edifice he intends to build;   each is a part of his mission, a mission that always bears on the   same subject: the misery and grandeur of what is human, the   slavery to which earthly life condemns us, and the heroic   struggle of the spirit for its liberation. This is the theme in   all the works we choose to recall at this time:\nGäst hos   verkligheten\n(1925) [\nGuest of Reality\n];\nHjärtats sånger\n(1926) [Songs from the Heart];\nHan som fick leva om sitt liv\n(1928) [He Who Lived His   Life Over Again]; Dvärgen (1944) [The Dwarfl];\nBarabbas\n(1950). It is needless to cite others to give an   idea of the scope of Lagerkvist’s inspirations and the power of   his genius.\nOne of the foreign experts who, on the fiftieth anniversary of   the Nobel Foundation, criticized the historic series of Nobel   Prize laureates, gave as criteria two conditions which seemed   equally indispensable to him: on the one hand the artistic value   of the finished work, on the other its international reputation.   Insofar as this last condition is concerned, it can immediately   be objected that those who write in a language that is not   widespread will find themselves at a great disadvantage. In any   case, it is extremely rare that a Nordic writer could make a   reputation with the international public, and, therefore, a fair   judgment on this kind of candidate is an especially delicate   matter. However, Nobel’s will explicitly prescribes that the   Prizes should be awarded«without any consideration of   nationality, so that they should be awarded to the worthiest, be   he Scandinavian or not.» That should also signify that if a   writer seems worthy of the Nobel Prize, the fact that he is   Swedish, for example, should not in the end hinder him from   obtaining it. As for Pär Lagerkvist, we must consider   another factor, which pleases us very much: his last work has   attracted much sympathy and esteem outside our frontiers. This   was further proved by the insistent recommendations with which   Lagerkvist’s candidacy has been sustained by a majority of   foreign advisers. He does not owe his Prize to the Academy circle   itself. That the moving interpretations of the inner conflicts of   Barabbas have found such repercussions even in foreign languages   clearly shows the profoundly inspired character of this work,   which is all the more remarkable as the style of it is original   and in a sense untranslatable. Indeed, in this language at once   harsh and sensitive, Lagerkvist’s compatriots often hear the echo   of Småland folklore reechoing under the starry vault of   Biblical legend. This reminds us once more that regional   individuality can sometimes be transformed into something   universal and accessible to all.\nOn each page of Pär Lagerkvist’s work are words and ideas   which, in their profound and fearful tenderness, carry at the   very heart of their purity a message of terror. Their origin is   in a simple, rustic life, laborious and frugal of words. But   these words, these thoughts, handled by a master, have been   placed at the service of other designs and have been given a   greater purpose, that of raising to the level of art an   interpretation of the time, the world, and man’s eternal   condition. That is why in the statement of the reasons for   awarding the Nobel Prize to Pär Lagerkvist, it seems   legitimate to us to affirm that this national literary production   has risen to the European level.\nDr. Lagerkvist – We who have followed you from close by know how   repugnant it is to you to be placed in the limelight. But since   that seems inevitable at this moment, I beg you only to believe   in the sincerity of our congratulations at the moment when you   receive this award which, according to us, you have deserved more   than any other at the present time. I have been obliged to sing   your praises in front of you. But if the occasion were less   solemn, I would be tempted to tell you quite simply, in the old   Swedish manner: may it bring you happiness.\nAnd now, it remains for me to ask you to receive from the hands   of our King the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1951.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1952\nNobel Prize in Literature 1952\nFrançois Mauriac\n- François Mauriac\nSwedish Academy\nThe student of François Mauriac’s   works will be struck from the very first by the insistence with   which Mauriac devotes himself to describing a precise milieu, a   corner of land one can point to on a map of France. The action of   his novels nearly always unfolds in the Gironde, the Bordeaux   region, that old vine-growing country where chateaux and small   farms have taken possession of the earth, or in the Landes, the   country of pine trees and sheep pastures where the song of the   cicadas vibrates in the lonely spaces, and where the Atlantic   sounds its far-off thunder. This is Mauriac’s native country. He   considers it his calling to describe this singular region and its   people, especially those who own the land; and it can be said   that his personal style partakes of the restrained energy which   twists the branches of the grape vines and of the pitiless   clarity of the light which falls from a torrid sky. In that   sense, this writer, who is read the world over, is undeniably and   markedly a man of the province, but his provincialism does not   exclude the great human problems of universal scope. If one wants   to dig deep one must first and always have a ground to thrust   one’s pick into.\nMauriac had a more than usually restricted childhood; he grew up   in the shelter of a milieu in which the maternal influence made   itself strongly felt, an influence which did not cease to act on   his adolescent sensitivity. There is reason to believe that he   had painful surprises later when he made contact with the outside   world. Guided until then by pious advice, he had not suspected   that evil dominated reality to such an extent as it appears in   all the monotony and indifference of everyday life. Catholic by   birth, brought up in a Catholic atmosphere which became his   spiritual country, he has, in short, never had to decide for or   against the Church. But he has on several occasions re-examined   and publicly specified his Christian position, above all in order   to question whether the demands a realist’s position made on the   writer could be reconciled with the commandments and prohibitions   of the Church. Apart from these inevitable and insoluble   antinomies, Mauriac, as a writer, uses the novel to expound a   particular aspect of human life in which Catholic thought and   sensitivity are at the same time background and keystone. Hence,   his non-Catholic readers may to a certain extent feel that they   are looking at a world foreign to them; but to understand   Mauriac, one must remember the one fact without which no account   of him can be complete: he does not belong to the group of   writers who are converts. He himself is conscious of the force   that gives him those roots which permit him to cite a great and   stern tradition when he probes souls overwhelmed by the weight of   their faults and scrutinizes their secret intentions.\nMauriac has been assured a central position in modern literature   for so long and so unquestionably that the denominational   barriers have almost lost all importance. Whereas many writers of   his generation who had a fleeting glory are almost forgotten   today, his profile stands out more and more distinctly with the   years. In his case it is not a question of fame achieved at the   price of compromise, for his sombre and austere vision of the   world is scarcely made to please his contemporaries. He has   always aimed high. With all the power and all the consistency of   which he is capable, he has tried to continue in his realistic   novels the tradition of such great French moralists as Pascal, La   Broyére, and Bossuet. To this let us add that he represents   a tendency toward religious inspiration which, particularly in   France, has always been an extremely important element of   spiritual formation. If I may in this context say a few words   about Mauriac as a distinguished journalist, we must not forget,   in the interest of European thought, his work in that field, his   commentaries on daily events, the entire side of his literary   activity which deserves public esteem.\nBut if he is today the laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature,   it is obviously above all because of his admirable novels.   Suffice it to name a few masterpieces such as\nLe Désert   de l’amour\n(1925) [\nThe Desert of Love\n],\nThérèse Desqueyroux\n(1927)   [\nThérèse\n], and its sequel\nLa Fin de la   nuit\n(1935) [The End of the Night],\nLa Pharisienne\n(1941) [A Woman of the Pharisees], and\nLe Noeud de   vipères\n(1932) [The Knot of Vipers], without intending   to say how far the artistic qualities of these works place them   in a class apart; for everywhere, in the whole series of   Mauriac’s novels, are found unforgettable scenes, dialogues, and   situations, so mysteriously and so cruelly revealing. The   repetition of the same themes could create a certain monotony,   but his acute analyses and sure touch awaken the same admiration   with each new encounter. Mauriac remains unequalled in   conciseness and expressive force of language; his prose can in a   few suggestive lines shed light on the most complex and difficult   things. His most remarkable works are characterized by a purity   of logic and classic economy of expression that recall the   tragedies of Racine.\nThe voiceless anxiety of youth, the abysses of evil and the   perpetual menace of their presence, the deceitful temptations of   the flesh, the ascendancy of avarice in the life of material   goods, the havoc of self-satisfaction and pharisaism – these are   the motifs that constantly reappear under Mauriac’s pen. Small   wonder that in his wielding of such a palette, he has been   accused of blackening his subjects without cause, of writing as a   misanthrope. But the response he gives is that, on the contrary,   a writer who bases his whole concept of the world on grace and   sees man’s supreme recourse in God’s love has the feeling of   working in a spirit of hope and confidence. We have no right to   doubt the sincerity of this declaration, but it is evident that   in practice sin attracts him more than innocence. He detests what   is edifying, and while he never grows tired of portraying the   soul that persists in evil and is on its way to damnation, he   generally prefers to bring down the curtain at the moment when   the consciousness of its misery is about to push the soul toward   repentance and salvation. This writer limits himself to the role   of witness to the negative phase of this evolution, leaving all   the positive side to the priest, who does not have to write a   novel.\nMauriac himself once said that everyone is free to seek   satisfaction in a literature that beautifies life and permits us   to escape from reality, but the predilection which most people   have for this kind of literature should not make us unjust toward   the writers whose vocation is to know man. It is not we who hate   life. Those alone hate life who, not being able to bear the sight   of it, falsify it. The true lovers of life love it as it is. They   have stripped it of its masks, one by one, and have given their   hearts to this monster at last laid bare. In one of his   controversies with Andre Gidé, he returned to the cardinal   point of his thought in affirming that the most complete   sincerity is the form of honour which is linked to the writer’s   craft. Most often Tartuffe is made to appear under the   ecclesiastical costume, but Mauriac assures us that this   personage is found much more frequently in the midst of those   supporting the theory of materialistic progress. It is easy to   deride the principles of morality, but Mauriac objects to such   derision; as he has stated quite simply, «Each of us knows   he could become less evil than he is.»\nThis simple phrase is perhaps the key that opens the secret of   good in the chapters of Mauriac’s work, the secret of their   sombre ardour and their subtle disharmony. His plunges into the   midst of man’s weaknesses and vices are more than the effect of a   mania pushed to virtuosity. Even when he analyzes reality without   pity, Mauriac preserves a last certainty, that there is a charity   which passes understanding. He does not lay claim to the   absolute; he knows that it does not exist with virtue in the pure   state, and he views without indulgence those who call themselves   pious. Faithful to the truth which he has made his, he strives to   describe his characters in such a way that, seeing themselves as   they are, they would be stricken with repentance and the desire   to become, if not better, at least a little less evil. His novels   can be compared to narrow but deep wells at the bottom of which a   mysterious water is seen glistening in the darkness.\nDear Sir and colleague – In the few moments at my disposal I   could speak about your work only in a sketchy manner.

One thinks of Julius Caesar,   Marcus Aurelius, and even Napoleon, whose letters to Josephine   during the first Italian campaign certainly have passion and   splendour. But the man who can most readily be compared with Sir   Winston Churchill is Disraeli, who also was a versatile author.   It can be said of Disraeli as Churchill says of Rosebery, that   «he flourished in an age of great men and small   events». He was never subjected to any really dreadful   ordeals. His writing was partly a political springboard, partly   an emotional safety valve. Through a series of romantic and   self-revealing novels, at times rather difficult to read, he   avenged himself for the humiliation and setbacks that he, the   Jewish stranger in an England ruled by aristocrats, suffered   despite his fantastic career. He was not a great writer but a   great actor, who played his leading part dazzlingly. He could   very well repeat Augustus’ words of farewell: «Applaud, my   friends, the comedy is over!»\nChurchill’s John Bull profile stands out effectively against the   elder statesman’s chalk-white, exotic mask with the black lock of   hair on the forehead. The conservative Disraeli revered the   English way of life and tradition which Churchill, radical in   many respects, has in his blood, including steadfastness in the   midst of the storm and the resolute impetus which marks both word   and deed. He wears no mask, shows no sign of cleavage, has no   complex, enigmatic nature. The analytical\nmorbidezza\n,   without which the modern generation finds it hard to imagine an   author, is foreign to him. He is a man for whom reality’s block   has not fallen apart. There, simply, lies the world with its   roads and goals under the sun, the stars, and the banners. His   prose is just as conscious of the goal and the glory as a runner   in the stadium. His every word is half a deed. He is heart and   soul a late Victorian who has been buffeted by the gale, or   rather one who chose of his own accord to breast the storm.\nChurchill’s political and literary achievements are of such   magnitude that one is tempted to resort to portray him as a   Caesar who also has the gift of Cicero’s pen. Never before has   one of history’s leading figures been so close to us by virtue of   such an outstanding combination. In his great work about his   ancestor, Marlborough, Churchill writes, «Words are easy and   many, while great deeds are difficult and rare.» Yes, but   great, living, and persuasive words are also difficult and rare.   And Churchill has shown that they too can take on the character   of great deeds.\nIt is the exciting and colourful side of Churchill’s writing   which perhaps first strikes the reader. Besides much else,\nMy   Early Life\n(1930) is also one of the world’s most   entertaining adventure stories. Even a very youthful mind can   follow with the keenest pleasure the hero’s spirited start in   life as a problem child in school, as a polo-playing lieutenant   in the cavalry (he was considered too dense for the infantry),   and as a war correspondent in Cuba, in the Indian border   districts, in the Sudan, and in South Africa during the Boer War.   Rapid movement, undaunted judgments, and a lively perception   distinguish him even here. As a word-painter the young Churchill   has not only verve but visual acuteness. Later he took up   painting as a hobby, and in\nThoughts and Adventures\n(1932)   discourses charmingly on the joy it has given him. He loves   brilliant colours and feels sorry for the poor brown ones.   Nevertheless, Churchill paints better with words. His battle   scenes have a matchless colouring. Danger is man’s oldest   mistress and in the heat of action the young officer was fired to   an almost visionary clear-sightedness. On a visit to Omdurman   many years ago I discovered how the final struggle in the   crushing of the Mahdi’s rebellion, as it is depicted in\nThe   River War\n(1899), was branded on my memory. I could see in   front of me the dervish hordes brandishing their spears and guns,   the ochre-yellow sand ramparts shot to pieces, the Anglo-Egyptian   troops’ methodical advance, and the cavalry charge which nearly   cost Churchill his life.\nEven old battles which must be dug out of dusty archives are   described by Churchill with awesome clarity. Trevelyan   masterfully depicts Marlborough’s campaigns, but in illusory   power it is doubtful that Churchill’s historic battle scenes can   be surpassed. Take, for instance, the Battle of Blenheim. One   follows in fascination the moves of the bloody chess game, one   sees the cannon balls plough their furrows through the compact   squares, one is carried away by the thundering charge and fierce   hand-to-hand fighting of the cavalry; and after putting the book   down one can waken in the night in a cold sweat, imagining he is   right in the front rank of English redcoats who, without   wavering, stand among the piles of dead and wounded loading their   rifles and firing their flashing salvoes.\nBut Churchill became far more than a soldier and a delineator of   war. Even in the strict but brilliant school of the parliamentary   gamble for power he was, perhaps from the outset, something of a   problem child. The young Hotspur learned, however, to bridle his   impetuosity, and he quickly developed into an eminent political   orator with the same gift of repartee as Lloyd George. His   sallies, often severe, excluded neither warmth nor chivalry. In   his alternation between Toryism and radicalism, he followed in   the footsteps of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill. He has also   portrayed the latter’s short, uneasy, tragically interrupted   political and personal life in a work which has an undisputed   place of honour in England’s profuse biographical   literature.\nEven the First World War, despite all setbacks, meant a vast   expansion for Churchill as both politician and writer. In his   historical works the personal and the factual elements have been   intimately blended. He knows what he is talking about. In gauging   the dynamics of events, his profound experience is unmistakable.   He is the man who has himself been through the fire, taken risks,   and withstood extreme pressure. This gives his words a vibrating   power. Occasionally, perhaps, the personal side gets the upper   hand. Balfour called\nThe World Crisis\n(1923-29)   «Winston’s brilliant autobiography, disguised as world   history.» With all due respect to archives and documents,   there is something special about history written by a man who has   himself helped to make it.\nIn his great book on the Duke of Marlborough (1933-38), whose   life’s work is so similar to Churchill’s own, he makes an   intrepid attack on his ancestor’s detractors. I do not know what   professional historians say of his polemic against Macaulay, but   these diatribes against the great general’s persistent haters and   revilers are certainly diverting and temperamental.\nThe Marlborough book is not only a series of vivid battle scenes   and a skillful defence of the statesman and warrior. It is also a   penetrating study of an enigmatic and unique personality; it   shows that Churchill, in addition to all else, is capable of real   character-drawing. He returns again and again to the confusing   mixture in Marlborough of methodical niggardliness and dazzling   virtuosity: «His private fortune was amassed», he says,   «upon the same principles as marked the staff-work of his   campaigns, and was a part of the same design. It was only in love   or on the battlefield that he took all risks. In these supreme   exaltations he was swept from his system and rule of living, and   blazed resplendent with the heroic virtues. In his marriage and   in his victories the worldly prudence, the calculation, the   reinsurance, which regulated his ordinary life and sustained his   strategy, fell from him like a too heavily embroidered cloak, and   the genius within sprang forth in sure and triumphant   command.» In his military enthusiasm Churchill forgets for a   moment that Marlborough’s famous and dearly loved Sarah was by no   means one to let herself be ordered about. But it is a wonderful   passage.\nChurchill regretted that he had never been able to study at   Oxford. He had to devote his leisure hours to educating himself.   But there are certainly no educational gaps noticeable in his   mature prose. Take, for example, Gr\neat Contemporaries\n(1937), one of his most charming books. He is said to have   moulded his style on Gibbon, Burke, and Macaulay, but here he is   supremely himself What a deft touch and at the same time what a   fund of human knowledge, generosity, and gay malice are in this   portrait gallery!\nChurchill’s reaction to\nBernard   Shaw\nis very amusing, a piquant meeting between two of   England’s greatest literary personalities. Churchill cannot   resist poking fun at Shaw’s blithely irresponsible talk and   flippancy, which contrasted with the latter’s fundamental   gravity. Half amused, half appalled, he winces at the way in   which the incorrigibly clowning genius was forever tripping   himself up and turning somersaults between the most extreme   antitheses. It is the contrast between the writer, who must at   all costs create surprises, and the statesman, whose task it is   to meet and master them.\nIt is not easy to sum up briefly the greatness of Churchill’s   style. He says of his old friend, the Liberal statesman, John   Morley, «Though in conversation he paraded and   manœuvred nimbly and elegantly around his own convictions,   offering his salutations and the gay compliments of old-time war   to the other side, [he] always returned to his fortified camp to   sleep.» As a stylist Churchill himself, despite his   mettlesome chivalry, is not prone to such amiable arabesques. He   does not beat about the bush, but is a man of plain speaking. His   fervour is realistic, his striking – power is tempered only by   broad-mindedness and humour. He knows that a good story tells   itself. He scorns unnecessary frills and his metaphors are rare   but expressive.\nBehind Churchill the writer is Churchill the orator – hence the   resilience and pungency of his phrases. We often characterize   ourselves unconsciously through the praise we give others.   Churchill, for instance, says of another of his friends, Lord   Birkenhead, «As he warmed to his subject, there grew that   glow of conviction and appeal, instinctive and priceless, which   constitutes true eloquence.» The words might with greater   justification have been said of Churchill himself.\nThe famous desert warrior, Lawrence of Arabia, the author of\nThe      Seven Pillars of Wisdom\n, is another who has both made and      written history. Of him Churchill says, «Just as an      aeroplane only flies by its speed and pressure against the      air, so he flew best and easiest in the hurricane.» It is      again striking how Churchill here too speaks of the same      genius that carried his own words through the storm of      events.\nChurchill’s mature oratory is swift, unerring in its aim, and   moving in its grandeur. There is the power which forges the links   of history. Napoleon’s proclamations were often effective in   their lapidary style. But Churchill’s eloquence in the fateful   hours of freedom and human dignity was heart-stirring in quite   another way. With his great speeches he has, perhaps, himself   erected his most enduring monument.\nLady Churchill – The Swedish Academy expresses its joy at your   presence and asks you to convey to Sir Winston a greeting of deep   respect. A literary prize is intended to cast lustre over the   author, but here it is the author who gives lustre to the prize.

Our generation in particular has, during the last   few decades, seen a reorientation of literary interest which   implies not only a temporary change in the market but, indeed, a   shifting of the mental horizon, with far-reaching consequences.   All these swiftly rising new authors from the United States,   whose names we now recognize as stimulating signals, had one   thing in common: they took full advantage of the Americanism to   which they were born. And the European public greeted them with   enthusiasm; it was the general wish that Americans should write   as Americans, thereby making their own contribution to the   contest in the international arena.\nOne of these pioneers is the author who is now the focus of   attention. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that Ernest   Hemingway, more than any of his American colleagues, makes us   feel we are confronted by a still young nation which seeks and   finds its exact form of expression. A dramatic tempo and sharp   curves have also characterized Hemingway’s own existence, in many   ways so unlike that of the average literary man. With him, this   vital energy goes its own way, independent of the pessimism and   the disillusionment so typical of the age. Hemingway evolved his   style in the herd school of journalistic reporting. In the   editorial office of the Kansas City newspaper where he served his   apprenticeship, there was a kind of pressman’s catechism, the   first dictum of which was: «Use short sentences. Use short   paragraphs.» Hemingway’s purely technical training clearly   led to an artistic self-discipline of uncommon strength.   Rhetoric, he has said, is merely the blue sparks from the dynamo.   His master in older American literature was Mark Twain in\nHuckleberry Finn\n, with its rhythmical stream of direct and   unconventional narrative prose.\nThe young journalist from Illinois was flung headlong into the   First World War when he volunteered to serve as an ambulance   driver in Italy, where he received his baptism of fire at the   Piave front and was severely wounded by shell splinters. The   nineteen-year-old’s first violent experience of war is an   essential factor in Hemingway’s biography. Not that he was   daunted by it; on the contrary, he found that it was a priceless   asset for a writer to see war at first hand – like Tolstoy at   Sevastopol – and to be able to depict it truthfully. Several   years were to elapse, however, before he could bring himself to   give an artistically complete account of his painfully confused   impressions from the Piave front in 1918: the result was the   novel\nA Farewell to Arms\nin 1929, with which he really   made his name, even if two very talented books with a European   post-war setting,\nIn Our Time\n(1942) and\nThe Sun Also   Rises\n(1926), had already given proof of his individuality as   a storyteller. In the following years, his instinctive   predilection for harrowing scenes of action and grim spectacle   drew him to Africa with its big-game hunting and to Spain with   its bullfighting. When the latter country was transformed into a   theatre of war, he found inspiration there for his second   significant novel,\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls\n(1940), in   which an American champion of liberty fights for «man’s   dignity» – a book in which the writer’s personal feelings   seem more deeply involved than anywhere else.\nWhen mentioning these principal elements in his production, one   should not forget that his narrative skill often attains its   highest point when cast in a smaller mould, in the laconic,   drastically pruned short story, which, with a unique combination   of simplicity and precision, nails its theme into our   consciousness so that every blow tells. Such a masterpiece, more   than any other, is\nThe Old Man and the Sea\n(1952), the   unforgettable story of an old Cuban fisherman’s duel with a huge   swordfish in the Atlantic. Within the frame of a sporting tale, a   moving perspective of man’s destiny is opened up; the story is a   tribute to the fighting spirit, which does not give in even if   the material gain is nil, a tribute to the moral victory in the   midst of defeat. The drama is enacted before our eyes, hour by   hour, allowing the robust details to accumulate and take on   momentous significance. «But man is not made for   defeat», the book says. «A man can be destroyed but not   defeated.»\nIt may be true that Hemingway’s earlier writings display brutal,   cynical, and callous sides which may be considered at variance   with the Nobel Prize’s requirement for a work of an ideal   tendency. But on the other hand, he also possesses a heroic   pathos which forms the basic element in his awareness of life, a   manly love of danger and adventure with a natural admiration for   every individual who fights the good fight in a world of reality   overshadowed by violence and death. In any event, this is the   positive side of his cult of manliness, which otherwise is apt to   become demonstrative, thereby defeating its own ends. It should   be remembered, however, that courage is Hemingway’s central theme   – the bearing of one who is put to the test and who steels   himself to meet the cold cruelty of existence, without, by so   doing, repudiating the great and generous moments.\nOn the other hand, Hemingway is not one of those authors who   write to illustrate theses and principles of one kind or another.   A descriptive writer must be objective and not try to play God   the Father – this he learned while still in the editorial office   in Kansas City. That is why he can conceive of war as a tragic   fate having a decisive effect on the whole of his generation; but   he views it with a calm realism, void of illusion, which disdains   all emotional comment, a disciplined objectivity, stronger   because it is hard-won.\nHemingway’s significance as one of this epoch’s great moulders of   style is apparent in both American and European narrative art   over the past twenty-five years, chiefly in the vivid dialogue   and the verbal thrust and parry, in which he has set a standard   as easy to imitate as it is difficult to attain. With masterly   skill he reproduces all the nuances of the spoken word, as well   as those pauses in which thought stands still and the nervous   mechanism is thrown out of gear. It may sometimes sound like   small talk, but it is not trivial when one gets to know his   method. He prefers to leave the work of psychological reflection   to his readers, and this freedom is of great benefit to him in   spontaneous observation.\nWhen one surveys Hemingway’s production, definite scenes flare up   in the memory – Lieutenant Henry’s flight in the rain and mud   after the panic at Caporetto, the desperate blowing up of the   bridge in the Spanish mountains when Jordan sacrifices his life,   or the old fisherman’s solitary fight with the sharks in the   nocturnal glow of lights from Havana.\nMoreover, one may trace a distinctive linking thread – let us say   a symbolic warp reaching back a hundred years in the loom of time   – between Hemingway’s latest work,\nThe Old Man and The   Sea\n, and one of the classic creations of American literature,   Herman   Melville’s novel\nMoby Dick\n, the white whale who is   pursued in blind rage by his enemy, the monomaniac sea captain.   Neither Melville nor Hemingway wanted to create an allegory; the   salt ocean depths with all their monsters are sufficiently   rewarding as a poetic element. But with different means, those of   romanticism and of realism, they both attain the same theme – a   man’s capacity of endurance and, if need be, of at least daring   the impossible. «A man can be destroyed but not   defeated.»\nThis year’s Nobel Prize in Literature has therefore been awarded   to one of the great authors of our time, one of those who,   honestly and undauntedly, reproduces genuine features in the hard   countenance of the age. Hemingway, now fifty-six years old, is   the fifth American author so far to be honoured in this way. As   the Prize winner himself is unfortunately unable to be present   for reasons of health, the Prize will now be handed to the United   States Ambassador.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

This is ultimately due to the peculiar nature and   development of the Icelandic community. In Iceland there were no   conditions for the rise of the class society elsewhere so   characteristic of the Middle Ages, with its sharp contrast   between Church and people, between the learned and the peasants.   There books were not, as in other lands, the privilege of a few   priests versed in Latin. Even in the Middle Ages literacy was far   more widespread among the common people in Iceland than in other   parts of Europe. This fact created the basic conditions for the   writing down in the native tongue of the old vernacular poetry   which, in the rest of northern Europe, our country included, was   despised and forgotten.\nSo it came about that the poor little nation on its remote island   created world literature, producing prose tales which the other   European countries were unable to match for hundreds of years.\nSnorre\nand the sagas will always stand out as peaks in the   art of historical narrative, as models of style in their   perspicuity, clarity, and vigour. The Icelandic saga, very   largely anonymous, is the product of a whole nation’s literary   talent and independent creative power.\nIn Iceland the saga has always been held in great honour. To the   Icelanders themselves it has given consolation and strength   during dark centuries of poverty and hardship. To this very day   Iceland stands out as the literary nation of the North\npar   excellence\n, in relation to its population and its   resources.\nEnormous power is necessary to renew in our time a narrative art   which has such traditions. In the book which Halldór Laxness   has written about the peasant poet Olafur   Ljósvíkíngur, he especially touches on the   problems and the mission of poetry, making one of the characters   say: “That poem is good which reaches the heart of the people.   There is no other criterion”. But in order to reach the people’s   heart, literary skill alone, however great, is not enough; the   ability to depict events and exploits is not enough. If   literature is to be a “light of the world”, it must strive to   give a true picture of human life and conditions. That goal runs   like a continuous thread through most of what Halldór   Laxness has written. And as he has an extraordinarily fine sense   of the concrete things of human life and, at the same time, an   inexhaustible gift of storytelling, he has come to rank as his   people’s greatest writer of the present age.\nOne of the most remarkable testimonies of the conflicts in modern   cultural life – not only in Iceland but in the whole of the West   – is Laxness’s early work,\nVefarinn mikli frá Kasmir\n(The Great Weaver from Kashmir), 1927. Despite a certain youthful   immaturity, it carries weight as a contemporary document and as a   personal confession. The main character is a young Icelander, a   writer with an artistic temperament, who, during a roving life in   Europe, experiences to the full the chaotic perplexity following   the First World War. Like Hans Alienus at one time, he tries to   get his bearings and to find a firm footing in life – but what a   difference in situation! Far more than a generation in time   separates them. On the one hand, peace, unshakable faith in   progress, dreams of beauty; on the other, a shattered, bleeding   world, moral laxity, anguish, and impotence. Steinn Ellioi   finally throws himself into the arms of the Catholic Church.   Since Strindberg, few books in the literature of   northern Europe have bared inner conflicts with such   uncompromising candour and shown how the indi vidual comes to   terms with the forces of the age.\nHalldór Laxness did not attain artistic balance until,   toward the end of the twenties, he returned to Iceland and found   his calling as bard of the Icelandic people. All his important   books have Icelandic themes.\nHe is an excellent painter of Icelandic scenery and settings. Yet   this is not what he has conceived as his chief mission.   “Compassion is the source of the highest poetry. Compassion with   Ásta Sóllilja on earth”, he says in one of his best   books. Art must be supported by sympathy and love for humanity;   otherwise it is worth very little. And a social passion underlies   everything Halldór Laxness has written. His personal   championship of contemporary social and political questions is   always very strong, sometimes so strong that it threatens to   hamper the artistic side of his work. His safeguard then is the   astringent humour which enables him to see even people he   dislikes in a redeeming light, and which also permits him to gaze   far down into the labyrinths of the human soul.\nIndividual people and their destinies always move us most deeply   in Halldór Laxness’s novels. Against the dark background of   poverty, strikes, and strife in the little Icelandic fishing   village, the shining, girlish figure of Salka Valka stands out,   resolute, capable, and pure of heart.\nEven more affecting, perhaps, is the story of Bjartur, the man   with the indomitable will for freedom and independence, Geijer’s   yeoman farmer in an Icelandic setting and, with monumental, epic   proportions, the settler, the\nlandnámsman\nof   Iceland’s thousand-year-old history. Bjartur remains the same in   sickness and misfortune, in poverty and starvation, in raging   snowstorms and face to face with the frightening monsters of the   moors, and pathetic to the last in his helplessness and his   touching love for his foster daughter, Ásta   Sóllilja.\nThe story of the peasant poet Olafur Ljósvíkíngur,\nLjós heimsins\n(The Light of the World), 1937-40, is   possibly his greatest work. It is based on the contrast between a   miserable environment and the heaven-born dreams of one who is a   friend and servant of beauty.\nIn\nIslandsklukkan\n(The Bell of Iceland), 1943-46, Laxness   for the first time sets the scene in a bygone age. And he indeed   succeeds in giving the atmosphere of the period both of Iceland   and of Denmark. Stylistically, it is a masterpiece. But even here   it is chiefly individuals and their destinies that one remembers:   the wretched tatterdemalion Jón Hreggviosson; “the fair   maid” Snaefriour Eydalín; and above all, the learned   collector of manuscripts, Arnas Arnaeus, in whom Iceland lives   more robustly than in anyone else.\nHalldór Laxness has guided literary development back to   common and traditional ground. That is his great achievement. He   has a vivid and personal style, easy and natural, and one gets a   strong impression of how well and how flexibly it serves his   ends.\nOne more thing must be emphasized if Laxness’s position is to be   properly understood. There was a time when the Icelandic authors   chose another Scandinavian language for their art, not merely for   economic reasons, but because they despaired of the Icelandic   language as an instrument for artistic creation. Halldór   Laxness has, in the field of prose, renewed the Icelandic   language as an artistic means of expression for a modern content,   and by his example he has given the Icelandic writers courage to   use their native tongue. Broadly speaking, therein lies his   greatest significance, and this is what has given him a strong   and very respected position in his own land.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

He is an old gardener, this Juan Ramón, who has   dedicated half a century to the creation of a new rose, a white   mystical rose, which will bear his name.\nJardines lejanos\n(Distant Gardens), 1904, is one of his   books from the beginning of the century. In the southern parts of   Andalusia, far off the route from Jerez to Seville well known to   Swedish tourists, the poet was born in 1881. But his poetry is   not a strong and intoxicating wine, and his work not a grandiose   mosque turned into a cathedral. It makes you think, rather, of   one of those gardens circled by high, whitewashed walls which you   see marking a landscape. He who stops a moment and goes in with   his camera runs the risk of being deceived. There is nothing   singular or picturesque here, only the usual things: fruit trees   and the air which vibrates on passing through them, the pond that   reflects the sun and the moon, a bird singing. No small minaret   has been transformed into an ivory tower in this fertile garden   planted in the soil of Arab culture. But the visitor who lingers   will notice that the passivity within the walls is deceiving,   that the isolation is only of the circumstantial and transitory,   of what pretends to be present. He will not fail to observe that   the rose has a radiance which demands sharper senses and a new   sensibility. There is a beauty which is more than the play and   delight of the senses; in front of the visitor the silent   gardener suddenly appears like a strict director of souls. At the   entrance of the Juanramonian garden the tourist ought to observe   the same rules as on entering a mosque: wash his hands and rinse   his mouth in the fountain for ablutions, take off his shoes,   etc.\nThe year in which Ramón Jiménez began to publish his   melodious verses was, in the history of Spain, a year for an   examination of conscience. On December 10, 1898, in Paris, was   signed the treaty with the United States by which Spain lost   Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, as well as what remained   of its navy and its prestige. By a stroke of the pen the remnants   of a whole colonial empire were eliminated. In Madrid a group of   writers took up the pen to reconquer, in their fashion, the world   within the boundaries of Spain. Some of them ultimately attained   their goals. The Machado brothers, Valle-Inclán, and Unamuno   were among them. The “modernists”, as they called themselves, had   in turn grouped themselves around their leader, the Nicaraguan   Rubén Darío, visiting in Spain. It was Darío also   who, at the beginning of the century, sponsored the first book of   verses of the new poet, Juan Ramón Jiménez, a book   which bore the scarcely martial title,\nAlmas de violeta\n(Souls of Violet), 1900.\nHe was not an audacious creator who would present himself on   stage in full light. His song arrived, timid and intimate, from a   penumbral background, and spoke of the moon and of melancholy   with echoes of Schumann and Chopin. He wept with Heine and with   his countryman, inspired by Heine, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer,   the exquisite poet to whom some short-sighted admirers gave the   name, “golden-haired Nordic King”. In the manner of Verlaine he   murmured his\nArias tristes\n(Sad Arias), 1903, in a   half-voice. When, little by little but with sure step, he had   freed himself from the gentle, captivating arms of French   symbolism, the characteristic features of music and intimacy   would remain forever impressed on him.\nMusic and painting – we can note that, in Seville, the young   student also studied to be a painter. Just as we speak of the   blue and rose periods of Picasso, who was born in the same year,   as the historians of literature have called attention to the   predominance of different colours in the work of Ramón   Jiménez. To the first period belong all the poems in yellow   and green – the famous green poem of his disciple Garcia Lorca   has its origin here. Later, white predominates, and the nakedness   of white characterizes the brilliant, decisive epoch which   includes what has been called the second poetic style of Juan   Ramón. Here we witness the long period of plenitude of a   poet of light. Far off are the melancholy mood-pictures, far off   also the anecdotal themes. The poems treat only of poetry and   love, and of the landscape and the sea which are identified with   poetry and love. A formal asceticism carried to perfection,   rejecting every exterior embellishment of the verse, will be the   road that will lead to the simplicity that is the supreme form of   art, the poetry that the poet calls naked.\nThis “second style of Juan Ramón” reaches its full   development in\nDiario de un poeta recién casado\n(Diary of a Newly-Wed Poet) in 1917. In this year the newly-wed   poet made his first trip to America and his diary is full of an   infinite feeling for the sea, full of oceanic poetry. His books\nEternidades\n(Eternities), 1918, and\nPiedra y cielo\n(Stone and Sky), 1919 mark new stages toward the longed-for   identification of the “I” with the world; poetry and thought have   the purpose of finding “the exact name for things”. Gradually the   poems become more concise, naked, transparent; they are, in fact,   maxims and aphorisms of the mystical poetics of Juan   Ramón.\nIn his constant zeal to surpass previous achievements, Ramón   Jiménez has made a clean slate of his earliest production   and has radically modified old poems, gathering those meriting   his approval into extensive anthologies. After his volumes\nBelleza\n(Beauty) and Poesía (Poetry) in 1923, in his   zeal to experiment with new forms, he abandoned the publication   of his works in book form and often published without title or   author’s name, in the form of sheets or leaflets scattered by the   wind. In 1936 the civil war interrupted the projected edition of   his works in twenty-one volumes.\nAnimal de fondo\n(Animal   of Depth), 1949, the last book from his period of exile, is, if   read by itself, a sample of a work in progress. Today, therefore,   it is still premature to discuss this phase which, in literary   history, will perhaps carry the title “the last style of Juan   Ramón”.\nFar away, in what was the colony of Puerto Rico, he is afflicted   today by an immense sorrow. It will not be possible for us to see   his thin face with its profound eyes and to ask ourselves if it   has been taken directly from a painting by El Greco. We find a   less solemn self-portrait in the delightful book,\nPlatero y   yo\n(Platero and I), 1914. There, dressed in mourning, the   poet passes with his Nazarene beard, riding his little donkey   while the gypsy children shout at the top of their voices: The   madman! The madman! The madman! … And in truth it is not always   easy to distinguish a madman from a poet. But for like spirits   the madness of this man has been eminent wisdom. Rafael Alberti,   Jorge Guillén, Pedro Salinas, and others who have written   their names in the recent history of Spanish poetry have been his   disciples; Federico Garcia Lorca is one of them, and so are the   Latin American poets, with\nGabriela   Mistral\nat their head. I cite the statement of a Swedish   journalist on being informed of the Nobel Prize in Literature for   this year: “Juan Ramón Jiménez is a born poet, one of   those who are born one day with the same simplicity with which   the sun’s rays shine, one who purely and simply has been born and   has given of himself, unconscious of his natural talents. We do   not know when such a poet is born. We know only that one day we   find him, we see him, we hear him, just as one day we see a plant   flower. We call this a miracle”.\nIn the annals of the Nobel Prize, Spanish literature has been one   of the distant gardens. Very rarely have we cast a glance inside.   This year’s laureate is the last survivor of the famous   “generation of 1898”. For a generation of poets on both sides of   the ocean which separates, and at the same time, unites the   Hispanic countries, he has been a master – the master, in effect.   When the Swedish Academy renders homage to Juan Ramón   Jiménez, it renders homage also to an entire epoch in the   glorious Spanish literature.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

        "ceremony_speech_text": "Enhanced Page Navigation\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1957\nNobel Prize in Literature 1957\nAlbert Camus\n- Albert Camus\nSwedish Academy\nFrench literature is no longer linked   geographically to the frontiers of France in Europe. In many   respects it reminds one of a garden plant, noble and   irreplaceable, which when cultivated outside its territory still   retains its distinctive character, although tradition and   variation alternately influence it. The Nobel Laureate for this   year, Albert Camus, is an example of this evolution. Born in a   small town in eastern Algeria, he has returned to this North   African milieu to find the source of all the determining   influences that have marked his childhood and youth. Even today,   the man Camus is aware of this great French overseas territory,   and the writer in him is often pleased to recall this fact.\nFrom a quasi-proletarian origin, Camus found it necessary to get   ahead in life on his own; a poverty-stricken student, he worked   at all sorts of jobs to meet his needs. It was an arduous   schooling, but one which, in the diversity of its teaching, was   certainly not useless to the realist he was to become. In the   course of his years of study, which he spent at the University of   Algiers, he belonged to a circle of intellectuals who later came   to play an important role in the North African Resistance. His   first books were published by a local publishing house in   Algiers, but at the age of twenty-five he reached France as a   journalist and soon came to make his reputation in the metropolis   as a writer of the first rank, prematurely tempered by the harsh,   feverish atmosphere of the war years.\nEven in his first writings Camus reveals a spiritual attitude   that was born of the sharp contradictions within him between the   awareness of earthly life and the gripping consciousness of the   reality of death. This is more than the typical Mediterranean   fatalism whose origin is the certainty that the sunny splendour   of the world is only a fugitive moment bound to be blotted out by   the shades. Camus represents also the philosophical movement   called Existentialism, which characterizes man’s situation in the   universe by denying it all personal significance, seeing in it   only absurdity. The term “absurd” occurs often in Camus’s   writings, so that one may call it a leitmotif in his work,   developed in all its logical moral consequences on the levels of   freedom, responsibility, and the anguish that derives from it.   The Greek myth of Sisyphus, who eternally rolls his rock to the   mountain top from which it perpetually rolls down again, becomes,   in one of Camus’s essays, a laconic symbol of human life. But   Sisyphus, as Camus interprets him, is happy in the depth of his   soul, for the attempt alone satisfies him. For Camus, the   essential thing is no longer to know whether life is worth living   but\nhow\none must live it, with the share of sufferings it   entails.\nThis short presentation does not permit me to dwell longer on   Camus’s always fascinating intellectual development. It is more   worthwhile to refer to the works in which, using an art with   complete classical purity of style and intense concentration, he   has embodied these problems in such fashion that characters and   action make his ideas live before us, without commentary by the   author. This is what makes\nL’Étranger\n(The Stranger),   1942, famous. The main character, an employee of a government   department, kills an Arab following a chain of absurd events;   then, indifferent to his fate, he hears himself condemned to   death. At the last moment, however, he pulls himself together and   emerges from a passivity bordering on torpor. In\nLa Peste\n(The Plague), 1947, a symbolic novel of greater scope, the main   characters are Doctor Rieux and his assistant, who heroically   combat the plague that has descended on a North African town. In   its calm and exact objectivity, this convincingly realistic   narrative reflects experiences of life during the Resistance, and   Camus extols the revolt which the conquering evil arouses in the   heart of the intensely resigned and disillusioned man.\nQuite recently Camus has given us the very remarkable   story-monologue,\nLa Chute\n(The Fall), 1956, a work   exhibiting the same mastery of the art of storytelling. A French   lawyer, who examines his conscience in a sailors’ bar in   Amsterdam, draws his own portrait, a mirror in which his   contemporaries can equally recognize themselves. In these pages   one can see Tartuffe shake hands with the Misanthrope in the name   of that science of the human heart in which classical France   excelled. The mordant irony, employed by an aggressive author   obsessed with truth, becomes a weapon against universal   hypocrisy. One may wonder, of course, where Camus is heading by   his insistence on a Kierkegaardian sense of guilt whose   bottomless abyss is omnipresent, for one always has the feeling   that the author has reached a turning point in his   development.\nPersonally Camus has moved far beyond nihilism. His serious,   austere meditations on the duty of restoring without respite that   which has been ravaged, and of making justice possible in an   unjust world, rather make him a humanist who has not forgotten   the worship of Greek proportion and beauty as they were once   revealed to him in the dazzling summer light on the Mediterranean   shore at Tipasa.\nActive and highly creative, Camus is in the centre of interest in   the literary world, even outside of France. Inspired by an   authentic moral engagement, he devotes himself with all his being   to the great fundamental questions of life, and certainly this   aspiration corresponds to the idealistic end for which the Nobel   Prize was established. Behind his incessant affirmation of the   absurdity of the human condition is no sterile negativism. This   view of things is supplemented in him by a powerful imperative, a   nevertheless, an appeal to the will which incites to revolt   against absurdity and which, for that reason, creates a   value.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

He was born near Syracuse, to be more exact,   in the little town of Modica some distance from the coast. It is   not difficult to imagine that a region so rich in memories of the   past must have been of the utmost importance for his future   calling. The relics of the ancient Greek temples on the island,   the theatres near the Ionian Sea, Arethusa’s fountain, so famed   in legend, the gigantic ruins at Girgenti and Slinunte – what a   playground for a child’s imagination! Here in days gone by the   heroes of Greek poetry were guests at the court of King Hieron,   here the voices of Pindar and Aeschylus linger like an echo   through the ages.\nEven if, as far as material matters are concerned, Quasimodo was   reared in comparative poverty, the milieu in which he spent his   youth was nevertheless something to be grateful for. Admittedly,   many restless years of travel were to pass before he became   conscious of his talent and began to find his way in the   classical heritage that was his. In due course, however, his   studies were to show their influence in his great contribution as   a translator of the literature of classical antiquity which now   forms the homogeneous background of his own work as one of the   foremost poets in the Italian language. There can hardly be any   doubt that his strict classical education acted as a stimulus,   not to servile imitation, but to energetic self-discipline in the   use of language and the achievement of artistic style. Although   regarded as one of the principal innovators in modern poetry,   Quasimodo is, nevertheless, bound to the classical tradition and   occupies this place with all the natural confidence of a true   heir.\nQuasimodo made his debut as early as 1930 but it was not until   the forties and fifties that he established his position as one   of Italy’s most outstanding poets, and by this time his   reputation had become international. He belongs to the same   generation as Silone, Moravia, and Vittorini, that is, the   generation of left-wing authors who were able to prove their   worth only after the fall of Fascism. Quasimodo is like these   writers in that for him, too, the fate of present-day Italy is a   reality in which he is deeply involved. His literary production   is not very large. In actual fact it consists of five books of   poetry, which reveal his development to complete individuality   and originality. I quote the characteristic titles of the   volumes:\nEd è subito sera\n(And Suddenly It’s   Evening), published in 1942,\nGiorno dopo giorno\n(Day after   Day), in 1946,\nLa vita non è sogno\n(Life Is Not a   Dream), in 1949,\nIl falso e vero verde\n(The False and the   True Green), in I956, and finally,\nLa terra impareggiabile\n(The Incomparable Earth), in 1958. Together they form one   homogeneous work in which not a single line is unimportant.\nQuasimodo has sung of the Sicily of his childhood and his youth   with a love that, since he went to live in the north of Italy,   has gained an ever-increasing depth and perspective – the   windswept island scenery with its Greek temple columns, its   desolate grandeur, its poverty-stricken villages, its dusty roads   winding through olive groves, its strident music of pounding surf   and shepherds’ horns. Nonetheless, he cannot be called a   provincial poet. The area from which he draws his themes   gradually increases, while at the same time his human pathos   breaks through the strict poetic form which first fettered him.   Above all, the bitter experiences of the war provided the impulse   for this change and made him an interpreter of the moral life of   his fellow countrymen in their daily experience of nameless   tragedies and constant confrontation with death. In this later   period he has created a number of poems that are so monumental   that one would like to believe that they will be accepted as a   lasting contribution to the world’s great poetry. Naturally,   Quasimodo is far from being the only Italian poet to be deeply   affected in this way by the martyrdom of his country and its   people, but the Sicilian poet’s dark and passionate earnestness   rings with a special and individual note when he ends one of his   lyrics with the cry:\nHowever much everything else is       distorted\nThe dead can never be sold.\nItaly is my country, o stranger,\nIt is of its people I sing, and of the sound\nOf secret lamentation that comes from its sea,\nI sing of its mothers’ chaste grief, of all its life.\nQuasimodo is of the bold opinion that   poetry does not exist for its own sake, but has an irrefutable   mission in the world, through its creative power, to recreate man   himself. To him, the road to freedom is the same as the conquest   of isolation, and his own progress points in the same direction.   In this way his work has become a living voice and his poetry an   artistic expression of the consciousness of the Italian people,   as far as this is possible for poetry with an otherwise so   concise and individual structure. In his poems, Biblical turns of   phrase are to be found side by side with allusions to classical   mythology, that mythology which is an ever-present source of   inspiration for a Sicilian. Christian compassion is the basic   quality of his poetry, which, in moments of greatest inspiration,   attains universality.\nDear Sir – The following statement pronounced by the Swedish   Academy is the reason for which you have been awarded the Nobel   Prize: “for his lyric poetry, which, with classical fire,   expresses the tragic experience of life in our own times”.\nYour poetry has come to us as an authentic and vivid message of   that Italy which has had faithful friends and admirers in our   nation for centuries.

Saint-John Perse is the   poet’s name that was to be made internationally famous by a   private man who in civil life is called Alexis Léger and, as   such, was to acquire great prestige in another domain of public   life. Thus his life is divided into two periods, one of which has   ended whereas the other is continuing: Alexis Léger, the   diplomat, has been transformed into Saint-John Perse, the   poet.\nConsidered as a literary personage, he presents a biography   remarkable in many respects. Born in 1887 in Guadeloupe, he   belonged to a French family that came to settle there as early as   the seventeenth century. He spent his childhood in this tropical   Eden of the Antilles, all rustling with palms, but at the age of   eleven he left for France with his family. He was educated at Pau   and at Bordeaux, decided to take a degree in law, and in 1914   entered upon a diplomatic career. Sent first to Peking, he next   found himself entrusted with increasingly important assignments.   As Secretary General for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for   several years, with the rank of Councillor of State, he assumed   major responsibilities during the political events that were the   prelude to the Second World War.\nAfter the defeat of France in 1940 he was abruptly suspended and   went into exile, was considered a dangerous adversary by the   Vichy regime, and was even deprived of his French citizenship. He   found refuge in Washington, where he occupied a position as   literary adviser to the Library of Congress. The French state was soon to   reinstate him in his full rights, but the exile firmly refused to   reenter diplomacy. In recent years, however, he has repeatedly   returned to France for private reasons.\nHere is a career which opens vast vistas and which presupposes in   the one who succeeds in it a breadth of perspective acquired   under many conditions, combined with a spiritual tone of uncommon   dynamic quality. This international versatility, the hallmark of   the great traveller, constitutes moreover one of the themes often   repeated in the poet’s work. He owed his first success to the   cycle of poems entitled\nPour fêter une enfance\n(To   Celebrate a Childhood), 1910, whose dazzling imagery evokes in   the golden dawn of childhood memories the exotic paradise of   Guadeloupe, its fabulous plants and animals. From China he   brought back an epic poem,\nAnabase\n(Anabasis), 1924, which   relates, in a form suggestive and hard as enamel, a mysterious   warlike expedition into the Asian deserts. The same,   uncompromisingly dense form, in which verse and prose are united   in a solemn flow blending Biblical verse with the rhythm of the   Alexandrine, is found again in the collections of poems which   followed:\nExil\n(Exile), 1942, and\nVents\n(Winds),   1946, both written in America. They constitute an imposing   statement of the uninterrupted cycle of degeneration and   rejuvenation, while\nAmers\n(Seamarks), 1957, celebrates the   sea, the eternal dispenser of power, the first cradle of   civilizations.\nThese works are, it is true, of marked singularity, complicated   in form and thought, but the master who created them is anything   but exclusive, if one means by that that he immures himself in a   satisfied autonomy and is interested only in himself. Quite the   contrary; his dominating quality is the wish to express the   human, seized in all its multiplicity, all its continuity; the   wish to describe man, forever the creator, struggling from   century to century against the equally perpetual insubordination   of the elements. He identifies himself with all the races who   have lived on our stormy planet. “Our race is old”, he said in a   poem, “our face is nameless. And time knows much about all the   men that we may have been… the ocean of things besets us. Death   is at the porthole, but our route is not there”.\nIn this exaltation of man’s creative power, Saint-John Perse may   sometimes recall the hymns of the German poet, Hölderlin,   who also was a magician of speech, filled with the grandeur of   the poetic vocation. It is very easy to treat this sublime faith   in the power of poetry as a paradox in order to belittle it,   especially when it seems to assert itself with a force inversely   proportional to the need of arousing an immediate response to the   thirst for human communion. On the other hand, Saint-John Perse   is an eloquent example of the isolation and estrangement which in   our era are a vital condition for poetic creation when its aim is   high.\nOne can only admire the integrity of his poetic attitude, the   lofty insistence with which he perseveres in the only mode of   expression that allows him to realize his intentions, an   exclusive but always pertinent form. The inexhaustible luxuriance   of the picturesque style of his rhapsodies is intellectually   demanding and may weary the reader of whom the poet demands such   efforts of concentration. He takes his metaphors from all   disciplines, from all eras, from all mythologies, from all   regions; his cycles of poems call to mind those great sea shells   from which a cosmic music seems to emanate. This expansive   imagination is his strength. Exile, separation – evocations whose   voiceless murmur gives his poetry its general tonality; and   through the double theme of man’s strength and helplessness a   heroic appeal can be perceived, an appeal which is perhaps   expressed more distinctly than before in the poet’s latest work,\nChronique\n(Chronicle), 1960, filled with a breath of   grandeur, in which the poet recapitulates everything, at the end   of the day, while making veiled allusions to the present state of   the world. And he even makes a prophetic appeal to Europe to have   it consider this fateful moment, this turning point in the course   of history. The poem ends with these words: “Great age, here we   are. Take measure of the heart of man”.\nIt is, then, correct to say that Saint-John Perse, behind an   apparent abstruseness and symbols frequently difficult to grasp,   brings a universal message to his contemporaries. One has every   reason to add that in his own way he perpetuates a majestic   tradition in French poetic art, especially the rhetorical   tradition inherited from the classics. In short, this honour   awarded to him only confirms the position he has acquired in   letters as one of the great leaders in poetry.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

He was born in 1892 to a family of artisans that had settled in Bosnia, a province still under Austrian rule when he was a child.\nAs a young Serbian student, he joined the national revolutionary movement, suffered persecution, and was imprisoned in 1914 when the war broke out. Nevertheless, he studied at several universities, finally obtaining his degree from Graz. For several years he served his country in the diplomatic service; at the outbreak of the Second World War he was the Yugoslav ambassador in Berlin. Only a few hours after his return to Belgrade, the city was bombed by German planes. Forced to retreat during the German occupation, Andric nevertheless managed to survive and to write three remarkable novels. These are generally called the Bosnian trilogy, although they have nothing in common but their historical setting, which is symbolized by the crescent and the cross. The creation of this work, in the deafening roar of guns and in the shadow of a national catastrophe whose scope then seemed beyond calculation, is a singularly striking literary achievement. The publication of the trilogy did not take place until 1945.\nThe epic maturity of these chronicles in novel form, especially of his masterpiece\nNa Drini ćuprija\n(The Bridge on the Drina), 1945, was preceded by a phase during which Andric, speaking in the first person of the lyric poet, sought to express the harsh pessimism of his young heart. It is significant that in the isolation of his years in prison he had found the greatest consolation in Kierkegaard. Later, in the asceticism of strict self-discipline, he discovered the way that could lead him back to what he called “the eternal unconscious and blessed patrimony”, a discovery that also signified the introduction into his work of the objective epic form which he henceforth cultivated, making himself the interpreter of those ancestral experiences that make a people conscious of what it is.\nNa Drini cuprija\nis the heroic story of the famous bridge which the vizier Mehmed Pasha had built during the middle of the sixteenth century near the Bosnian city of Visegrad. Firmly placed on its eleven arches of light-coloured stone, richly ornamented, and raised in the middle by a superstructure, it proudly perpetuated the memory of an era throughout the following eventful centuries until it was blown up in the First World War. The vizier had wanted it to be a passage that would unite East and West in the centre of the Ottoman Empire. Armies and caravans would cross the Drina on this bridge, which for many generations symbolized permanence and continuity underneath the contingencies of history. This bridge became the scene for every important event in this strange corner of the world. Andric’s local chronicle is amplified by the powerful voice of the river, and it is, finally, a heroic and bloody act in world history that is played here.\nIn the following work,\nTravnicka hronika\n(Bosnian Story), 1945, the action takes place at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Here we witness the rivalry between the Austrian and French consuls in a desolated, old-fashioned city where a Turkish vizier has established his residence. We find ourselves in the midst of events which bring together tragic destinies. The discontent which stirs among the bazaars in the alleys of Travnik; the revolts of the Serbo-Croation peasants; the religious wars between Mohammedans, Christians, and Jews – all of this contributes to create the atmosphere that, after a century of tension, was going to be rent by the lightning at Sarajevo. Again, Andric’s power is revealed in the breadth of his vision and the masterly control of his complex subject matter.\nThe third volume,\nGospodjica\n(The Woman from Sarajevo), 1945, is different; it is a purely psychological study of avarice in its pathological and demoniac aspect. It tells the story of a merchant’s daughter who lives alone in Sarajevo. Her bankrupt father had told her on his death-bed to defend her interests ruthlessly, since wealth is the only means of escape from the cruelties of existence. Although the portrait is strikingly successful, Andric here confines himself to a subject that does not permit him a full display of his great narrative gifts. They are revealed fully, however, in a minor work that should receive at least a brief mention:\nProkleta avilija\n(Devil’s Yard), 1954. A story set in an Istanbul prison, it is as colourful in its pattern as an Oriental tale and yet realistic and convincing.\nGenerally speaking, Andric combines modern psychological insight with the fatalism of the\nArabian Nights.\nHe feels a great tenderness for mankind, but he does not shrink from horror and violence, the most visible proof to him of the real presence of evil in the world. As a writer he possesses a whole network of original themes that belong only to him; he opens the chronicle of the world, so to speak, at an unknown page, and from the depth of the suffering souls of the Balkan slaves he appeals to our sensibility.\nIn one of his novellas, a young doctor recounting his experiences in the Bosnia of the 1920s says, “If you lie awake one whole night in Sarajevo, you learn to distinguish the voices of the Sarajevian night. With its rich and firm strokes the clock of the Catholic cathedral marks the hour of two. A long minute elapses; then you hear, a little more feeble, but shrill, the voice of the Orthodox Church, which also sounds its two strokes. Then, a little more harsh and far away, there is the voice of the Beg Mosque clock; it sounds eleven strokes, eleven ghostly Turkish hours, counted after the strange division of time in those far-off regions. The Jews have no bell to toll their hours, and God alone knows what time it is for them, God alone knows the number indicated on the calendar of the Sephardims and the Ashkenazims. Thus, even in the deep of the night, when everybody sleeps, the world is divided; it is divided over the counting of the lost hours of a night that is coming to an end.”\nPerhaps this suggestive nocturnal atmosphere also gives a key to the chief problems that have dominated Andric’s work. The study of history and philosophy has inevitably led him to ask what forces, in the blows and bitterness of antagonisms and conflicts, act to fashion a people and a nation. His own spiritual attitude is crucial in that respect. Considering these antagonisms with a deliberate and acquired serenity, he endeavours to see them all in the light of reason and with a profoundly human spirit. Herein lies, in the last analysis, the major theme of all his work; from the Balkans it brings to the entire world a stoic message, as our generation has experienced it.\nDear Sir – It is written on your diploma that the Nobel Prize has been bestowed upon you “for the epic force with which you have traced themes and depicted human destinies from your country’s history.” It is with great satisfaction that the Swedish Academy honours in you a worthy representative of a linguistic area which, up to now, has not appeared on the list of laureates.

This locality forms the background for   many of his descriptions of the common man’s everyday life. He   was raised in moderate circumstances, yet he was on equal terms   with the workers’ families in this rather diversified area. While   studying at Stanford University, he often had to earn his living   by working on the ranches. He left Stanford without graduating   and, in 1925, went to New York as a freelance writer. After   bitter years of struggling to exist, he returned to California,   where he found a home in a lonely cottage by the sea. There he   continued his writing.\nAlthough he had already written several books by 1935, he   achieved his first popular success in that year with\nTortilla   Flat.\nHe offered his readers spicy and comic tales about a   gang of\npaisanos\n, asocial individuals who, in their wild   revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur’s Knights of the   Round Table. It has been said that in the United States this book   came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing   depression. The laugh was now on Steinbeck’s side.\nBut he had no mind to be an unoffending comforter and   entertainer. The topics he chose were serious and denunciatory,   as for example the bitter strikes on California’s fruit and   cotton plantations which he depicted in his novel\nIn Dubious   Battle\n(1936). The power of his literary style increased   steadily during these years. The little masterpiece\nOf Mice   and Men\n(1937), which is the story of Lennie, the imbecile   giant who, out of tenderness, alone squeezes the life out of   every living creature that comes into his hands, was followed by   those incomparable short stories which he collected in the volume\nThe Long Valley\n(1938). The way had now been paved for the   great work that is principally associated with Steinbeck’s name,   the epic chronicle\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n(1939). This is the   story of the emigration to California which was forced upon a   group of people from Oklahoma through unemployment and abuse of   power. This tragic episode in the social history of the United   States inspired in Steinbeck a poignant description of the   experiences of one particular farmer and his family during their   endless, heartbreaking journey to a new home.\nIn this brief presentation it is not possible to dwell at any   length on individual works which Steinbeck later produced. If at   times the critics have seemed to note certain signs of flagging   powers, of repetitions that might point to a decrease in   vitality, Steinbeck belied their fears most emphatically with\nThe Winter of Our Discontent\n(1961), a novel published   last year. Here he attained the same standard which he set in\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n. Again he holds his position as an   independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for   what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.\nIn this recent novel, the central figure is the head of a family   who has come down in the world. After serving in the war, he   fails at whatever he tries until at last he is employed in the   simple work of a grocery store clerk in the New England town of   his forefathers. He is an honest man and he does not complain   without due cause, although he is constantly exposed to   temptation when he sees the means by which material success must   be purchased. However, such means require both hard   scrupulousness and moral obduracy, qualities he cannot muster   without risking his personal integrity. Tellingly displayed in   his sensitive conscience, irradiated like a prism, is a whole   body of questions which bear on the nation’s welfare problems.   This is done without any theorizing, using concrete, or even   trivial, everyday situation, which are nonetheless convincing   when described with all of Steinbeck’s vigorous and realistic   verve. Even with his insistence on the factual, there are   harmonic tones of daydreaming, fumbling speculations around the   eternal theme of life and death.\nSteinbeck’s latest book is an account of his experiences during a   three-month tour of forty American states\nTravels with   Charley,\n(1962). He travelled in a small truck equipped with   a cabin where he slept and kept his stores. He travelled   incognito, his only companion being a black poodle. We see here   what a very experienced observer and\nraisonneur\nhe is. In   a series of admirable explorations into local colour, he   rediscovers his country and its people. In its informal way this   book is also a forceful criticism of society. The traveller in   Rosinante – the name which he gave his truck – shows a slight   tendency to praise the old at the expense of the new, even though   it is quite obvious that he is on guard against the temptation.   “I wonder why progress so often looks like destruction”, he says   in one place when he sees the bulldozers flattening out the   verdant forest of Seattle to make room for the feverishly   expanding residential areas and the skyscrapers. It is, in any   case, a most topical reflection, valid also outside   America.\nAmong the masters of modern American literature who have already   been awarded this Prize – from\nSinclair Lewis\nto\nErnest Hemingway\n– Steinbeck more than   holds his own, independent in position and achievement. There is   in him a strain of grim humour which, to some extent, redeems his   often cruel and crude motif. His sympathies always go out to the   oppressed, to the misfits and the distressed; he likes to   contrast the simple joy of life with the brutal and cynical   craving for money. But in him we find the American temperament   also in his great feeling for nature, for the tilled soil, the   wasteland, the mountains, and the ocean coasts, all an   inexhaustible source of inspiration to Steinbeck in the midst of,   and beyond, the world of human beings.\nThe Swedish Academy’s reason for awarding the prize to John   Steinbeck reads, “for his realistic as well as imaginative   writings, distinguished by a sympathetic humour and a keen social   perception.”\nDear Mr. Steinbeck – You are not a stranger to the Swedish public   any more than to that of your own country and of the whole world.   With your most distinctive works you have become a teacher of   good will and charity, a defender of human values, which can well   be said to correspond to the proper idea of the Nobel Prize.

Seferis studied in Paris, then entered the diplomatic service,   went into exile with the Free Greek Government when Greece was   occupied in 1941, and was moved about from country to country   during the Second World War, when he served his country in Crete,   in Cairo, in South Africa, in Turkey, and in the Middle East.   After six years as ambassador in London, he retired last year and   returned to Athens to devote himself entirely to his literary   work.\nSeferis’s poetic production is not large, but because of the   uniqueness of its thought and style and the beauty of its   language, it has become a lasting symbol of all that is   indestructible in the Hellenic affirmation of life. Now that   Palamas and Sikelianos are dead, Seferis is today the   representative Hellenic poet, carrying on the classical heritage;   a leading national figure, he is also acclaimed abroad in so far   as his poetry has been made available in translation. Here in   Sweden his work was presented thirteen years ago by Hjalmar   Gullberg, whose translations included the famous\nThe King of   Asine,\nthe theme of which has a connection with Sweden   because of our archaeologists’ successful excavations on this   site. Using imagination as a tool, Seferis tries in this poem to   penetrate the secret behind a name that is merely mentioned in a   verse of the Iliad.\nWhen reading Seferis we are forcibly reminded of a fact that is   sometimes forgotten: geographically, Greece is not only a   peninsula but also a world of water and foam, strewn with myriad   islands, an ancient sea kingdom, the perilous and stormy home of   the mariner. This Greece is the constant background of his   poetry, in which it is conjured up as the vision of a grandeur   both harsh and tender. Seferis does this with a language of rare   subtlety, both rhythmical and metaphorical. It has rightly been   said that he, better than anyone else, has interpreted the   mystery of the stones, of the dead fragments of marble, and of   the silent, smiling statues. In his evocative poems, figures from   ancient Greek mythology appear together with recent events in the   Mediterranean’s bloody theatre of war. His poetry sometimes seems   difficult to interpret, particularly because Seferis is reluctant   to expose his inner self, preferring to hide behind a mask of   anonymity. He often expresses his grief and bitterness through   the medium of a central narrative figure, a kind of Odysseus with   features borrowed from the old seamen in the lost Smyrna of the   poet’s youth. But in his hollow voice is dramatized much of   Greece’s historical fatality, its shipwrecks and its rescues, its   disasters and its valour. Technically, Seferis has received vital   impulses from\nT. S. Eliot\n, but   underneath the tone is unmistakably his own, often carrying a   broken echo of the music from an ancient Greek chorus.\nSeferis once described himself, “I am a monotonous and obstinate   man who, for twenty years, has not ceased to say the same things   over and over again.” There is perhaps some truth in this   description, but one must remember that the message he feels   bound to convey is inseparable from the intellectual life of his   generation as it finds itself confronted with ancient Greek   civilization, a heritage that presents a formidable challenge to   the impoverished heir. In one of his most significant poems   Seferis describes a dream in which a marble head – too heavy for   his arms, yet impossible to push aside – fell upon him at the   moment of awakening. It is in this state of mind that he sings   the praise of the dead, for only communication with the dead   conversing on their asphodel meadows can bring to the living a   hope of peace, confidence, and justice. In Seferis’s   interpretation the story of the Argonauts becomes a parable   halfway between myth and history, a parable of oarsmen who must   fail before they reach their goal.\nBut Seferis animates this background of melancholy resignation   with the eloquent joy inspired in him by his country’s   mountainous islands with their whitewashed houses rising in   terraces above an azure sea, a harmony of colours that we find   again in the Greek flag. In concluding this brief presentation, I   should like to add that the prize has been awarded to Seferis   “for his eminent lyrical writing, inspired by a deep feeling for   the Hellenic world of culture.”\nDear Sir – In honouring you, it has been a great privilege for   the Swedish Academy to pay its tribute to the Greece of today,   whose rich literature has had to wait, perhaps too long, for the   Nobel laurels. Extending to you the congratulations of the   Swedish Academy, I ask you to receive from the hands of His   Majesty, the King, this year’s Prize in Literature.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The fact that he has declined   this distinction does not in the least modify the validity of the   award. Under the circumstances, however, the Academy can only   state that the presentation of the prize cannot take place.\nRefusal\nIn a public announcement, printed in\nLe   Figaro\nof October 23, 1964, Mr. Sartre expressed his regret   that his refusal of the prize had given rise to scandal, and   wished it to be known that, unaware of the irrevocability of the   Swedish Academy’s decisions, he had sought by letter to prevent   their choice falling upon him. In this letter, he specified that   his refusal was not meant to slight the Swedish Academy but was   rather based on personal and objective reasons of his own.\nAs to personal reasons, Mr. Sartre pointed out that due to his   conception of the writer’s task he had always declined official   honours and thus his present act was not unprecedented. He had   similarly refused membership in the Legion of Honour and had not   desired to enter the Collège de France, and he would refuse   the Lenin Prize if it were offered to him. He stated that a   writer’s accepting such an honour would be to associate his   personal commitments with the awarding institution, and that,   above all, a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an   institution.\nAmong his objective reasons, Mr. Sartre listed his belief that   interchange between East and West must take place between men and   between cultures without the intervention of institutions.   Furthermore, since the conferment of past prizes did not, in his   opinion, represent equally writers of all ideologies and nations,   he felt that his acceptance might be undesirably and unjustly   interpreted.\nMr. Sartre closed his remarks with a message of affection for the   Swedish public.\nAt the banquet, S. Friberg, Rector of the\nCaroline   Institute\n, made the following remarks: “Mr. Sartre found   himself unable to accept this year’s Prize in Literature. There   is always discussion about this prize, which every one considers   himself capable of judging, or which he does not understand and   consequently criticizes. But I believe that Nobel would have had   a great understanding of this year’s choice. The betterment of   the world is the dream of every generation, and this applies   particularly to the true poet and scientist. This was Nobel’s   dream. This is one measure of the scientist’s significance. And   this is the source and strength of Sartre’s inspiration. As an   author and philosopher, Sartre has been a central figure in   postwar literary and intellectual discussion – admired, debated,   criticized. His explosive production, in its entirety, has the   impress of a message; it has been sustained by a profoundly   serious endeavour to improve the reader, the world at large. The   philosophy, which his writings have served, has been hailed by   youth as a liberation. Sartre’s existentialism may be understood   in the sense that the degree of happiness which an individual can   hope to attain is governed by his willingness to take his stand   in accordance with his ethos and to accept the consequences   thereof; this is a more austere interpretation of a philosophy   admirably expressed by Nobel’s contemporary, Ralph Waldo Emerson:   ‘Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own   mind.'”\nThe quality of human life depends not only on external conditions   but also on individual happiness. In our age of standardization   and complex social systems, awareness of the meaning of life for   the individual has perhaps not been lost, but it has certainly   been dulled; and it is as urgent for us today as it was in   Nobel’s time to uphold the ideals which were his.”\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Announcement.

Sholokhov’s childhood was spent in the country of the Don   Cossacks; and the strong ties that have always bound him to this   district grew out of his sympathy for the highly individual   temperament of its people and the wildness of its landscape. He   saw his native province pass through the various phases of the   revolution and the Russian civil war. After he had tried his hand   at manual work in Moscow for a while, he soon began to   concentrate on writing and produced a series of sketches   describing the battles along the Don, a genre that was later to   bring him fame. It is striking evidence of the precociousness of   the war generation that Sholokhov was only 21 when he set to work   on the first parts of the great epic novel,\nAnd Quiet Flows   the Don\n. Its Russian title is simply,\nThe Quiet Don\n,   which acquires an undeniably ironic undertone in view of the   extreme violence of the action in Sholokhov’s masterpiece.\nIt took Sholokhov 14 years to complete the project, a highly   exacting one in every way, covering as it does the period   including the First World War, the Revolution and the Civil War,   and, having as its main theme, the tragic Cossack revolt. The   four parts of the epic appeared at relatively long intervals   between 1928 and 1940, and were long viewed with some concern by   the Soviet critics, whose political affiliation made it difficult   for them to accept, wholeheartedly, Sholokhov’s quite natural   commitment to his theme, that of the Cossacks’ revolt against the   new central authorities; nor could they easily accept his   endeavour to explain and defend objectively the defiant spirit of   independence that drove these people to resist every attempt at   subjection.\nIn view of the controversial aspects of his theme there can   surely be no doubt that in starting out upon the writing of this   novel Sholokhov was taking a daring step, a step which, at that   point in his career, also meant the settling of a conflict with   his own conscience.\nAnd Quiet Flows the Don\nis so well known to Swedish   readers that an introduction may well seem superfluous. With   magnificent realism the book portrays the unique character of the   Cossack, the traditional mixture of cavalryman and farmer, with   instincts that seem to conflict with one another but which   nevertheless allow themselves to be welded together to form a   firmly co-ordinated whole. There is no glamorization. The coarse   and savage streaks in the Cossack temperament are displayed   openly; nothing is hidden or glossed over, but, at the same time,   one is aware of an undercurrent of respect for all that is human.   Although a convinced Communist, Sholokhov keeps ideological   comment out of his book completely and we are compensated for the   amount of blood shed in the battles he describes by the   full-blooded vigour of his narrative.\nThe Cossack’s son, Gregor, who goes over from the Reds to the   Whites and is forced against his will to continue the struggle to   its hopeless conclusion is both hero and victim. The conception   of honour that he has inherited is put to the sternest of tests,   and he is defeated by a necessity of history which here plays the   same role as the classical Nemesis. But our sympathy goes out to   him and to the two unforgettable women, Natalja, his wife, and   Aksinia, his mistress, who both meet disaster for his sake. When   he finally returns to his native village, after digging Aksinia’s   grave with his sabre out on the steppe, he is a grey-haired man   who has lost everything in life but his young son.\nStretching away behind the whole gallery of figures, seen either   in their personal relationships or playing their parts as   military personnel, lies the mighty landscape of the Ukraine, the   steppes in all the changing seasons, the villages with their   sweet-smelling pastures and grazing horses, the grass billowing   in the wind, the banks of the river and the never-ending murmur   of the river itself. Sholokhov never tires of describing the   Russian steppes. Sometimes he breaks off the narrative right in   the middle of his story to burst out in exultation:\n“My beloved steppes under the low sky of the Don country! Ravines   winding across the plain with their walls of red earth, a sea of   waving feather-grass, marked only by the print of horses’ hoofs   leaving trail like a myriad birds’ nests, and by the graves of   the Tartars who in wise silence watch over the buried glory of   the Cossacks… I bow low before you, and, as a son, kiss your   fresh earth, unspoiled steppe of the Don Cossacks, watered with   blood.”\nIt may well be said that Sholokhov is using a well-tried   realistic technique, breaking no new ground, a technique that may   seem naive in its simplicity if we set it beside that offered us   in many a later model in the art of novel-writing. But his   subject surely could not have been presented in any other way,   and the powerful, evenly-sustained, epic flow of the writing   makes\nAnd Quiet Flows the Don\na genuine\nroman   fleuve\nin two senses.\nSholokhov’s more recent work, for example,\nPodnyataya   tselina\n, 1932 and 1959 (Virgin Soil Upturned) – a novel   describing compulsory collectivization and the introduction of\nkolkhozy\n– has a vitality that never flags and shows us   Sholokhov’s fondness for characters that are richly comic but at   the same time observed with a sympathetic eye. But, of course,\nAnd Quiet Flows the Don\nwould, on its own, thoroughly   merit the present award, a distinction which, it is true, has   come rather late in the day, but happily not too late to add to   the roll of Nobel prize-winners the name of one of the most   outstanding writers of our time.\nIn support of its choice the Swedish Academy speaks of “the   artistic power and integrity with which, in his epic of the Don,   Sholokhov has given expression to a historic phase in the life of   the Russian people”.\nSir – this distinction is intended as a tribute of justice and   gratitude to you for your important contribution to modern   Russian literature, a contribution as well-known in this country   as it is all over the world. May I offer you the congratulations   of the Swedish Academy, and at the same time, ask you to receive   from His Majesty, the King, this year’s Nobel Prize in   Literature.\nFrom\n, Literature 1901-1967\n, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Agnon’s home is in Jerusalem, and Miss Sachs has   been an immigrant in Sweden since 1940, and is now a Swedish   subject. The purpose of combining these two prizewinners is to do   justice to the individual achievements of each, and the sharing   of the prize has its special justification: to honour two writers   who, although they write in different languages, are united in a   spiritual kinship and complement each other in a superb effort to   present the cultural heritage of the Jewish people through the   written word. Their common source of inspiration has been, for   both of them, a vital power.\nI\nShmuel Agnon’s reputation as the foremost   writer in modern Hebrew literature has gradually penetrated   linguistic barriers which, in this case, are particularly   obstructive. His most important works are now available in   Swedish under the title\nI havets mitt\n(In the Heart of the   Seas). Agnon, now seventy-eight years old, began writing in   Yiddish but soon changed to Hebrew, which, according to experts,   he handles with absolute mastery, in a taut and sonorous prose   style of extraordinary expressiveness. He was only twenty when he   left his native town in East Galicia, where, as the scion of an   old and respected family, he had been brought up in a scholarly   tradition. He felt drawn to Palestine, where now, as an aged   classical author, he can look back on the long struggle for   national reestablishment, and where the so-called cultural   Zionism possesses in him one of its finest creative   champions.\nAgnon’s unique quality as a writer is apparent chiefly in the   great cycle of novels set in his native town of Buczacz, once a   flourishing centre of Jewish piety and rabbinical learning, now   in ruins. Reality and legend stand side by side in his narrative   art.\nHakhnasat Kalah\n, 1922 (The Bridal Canopy), is one of   his most characteristic stories, in its ingenious and earthy   humour, a Jewish counterpart to\nDon Quixote\nand\nTill   Eulenspiegel\n. But, perhaps, his greatest achievement is his   novel\nOreach Nata Lalun\n, 1939 (A Guest for the Night),   which tells of a visit to Buczacz, the war-ruined city of his   childhood, and of the narrator’s vain attempts to assemble the   congregation for a service in the synagogue. Within the framework   of a local chronicle we see a wonderful portrayal of destinies   and figures, of experience and meditation. The lost key to the   prayer house, which the traveller finds in his knapsack only   after his return to Jerusalem, is, for Agnon, a symbolic hint   that the old order can never be rebuilt in the Diaspora, but only   under the protection of Zionism. Agnon is a realist, but there is   always a mystical admixture which lends to even the greyest and   most ordinary scenes a golden atmosphere of strange fairy-tale   poetry, often reminiscent of Chagall’s motifs from the world of   the Old Testament. He stands out as a highly original writer,   endowed with remarkable gifts of humour and wisdom, and with a   perspicacious play of thought combined with naive perception – in   all, a consummate expression of the Jewish character.\nII\nNelly Sachs, like so many other   German-Jewish writers, suffered the fate of exile. Through   Swedish intervention she was saved from persecution and the   threat of deportation and was brought to this country. She has   since then worked in peace as a refugee on Swedish soil,   attaining the maturity and authority that are now confirmed by   the Nobel Prize. In recent years she has been acclaimed in the   German world as a writer of convincing worth and irresistible   sincerity. With moving intensity of feeling she has given voice   to the worldwide tragedy of the Jewish people, which she has   expressed in lyrical laments of painful beauty and in dramatic   legends. Her symbolic language boldly combines an inspired modern   idiom with echoes of ancient biblical poetry. Identifying herself   totally with the faith and ritual mysticism of her people, Miss   Sachs has created a world of imagery which does not shun the   terrible truth of the extermination camps and the corpse   factories, but which, at the same time, rises above all hatred of   the persecutors, merely revealing a genuine sorrow at man’s   debasement. Her purely lyrical production is now collected under   the title\nFahrtins Staublose\n, 1961 (Journey to the   Beyond), which comprises six interconnected works written during   a twenty-year creative period of increasing concentration. There   is also a series of dramatic poems, equally remarkable in their   way, under the joint title\nZeichen im Sand\n, 1961 (Signs in   the Sand), the themes of which might have been taken from the   dark treasure house of Hassidic mysticism, but which, here, have   taken on new vigour and vital meaning. Let it suffice here to   mention the mystery play\nEli\n(1950) about an   eight-year-old boy who is beaten to death by a German soldier in   Poland when he blows on his shepherd’s pipe to call on heaven’s   help when his parents are taken away. The visionary cobbler   Michael manages to trace the culprit to the next village. The   soldier has been seized by remorse and, at the encounter in the   forest, he collapses without Michael’s having to raise his hand   against him. This ending denotes a divine justice which has   nothing to do with earthly retribution.\nNelly Sachs’s writing is today the most intense artistic   expression of the reaction of the Jewish spirit to suffering, and   thus it can indeed be said to fulfill the humane purpose   underlying Alfred Nobel’s will.\nDoctor Agnon – according to the wording of the diploma, this   year’s Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to you for your   “profoundly distinctive narrative art with motifs from the life   of the Jewish people”.

Agnon’s home is in Jerusalem, and Miss Sachs has   been an immigrant in Sweden since 1940, and is now a Swedish   subject. The purpose of combining these two prizewinners is to do   justice to the individual achievements of each, and the sharing   of the prize has its special justification: to honour two writers   who, although they write in different languages, are united in a   spiritual kinship and complement each other in a superb effort to   present the cultural heritage of the Jewish people through the   written word. Their common source of inspiration has been, for   both of them, a vital power.\nI\nShmuel Agnon’s reputation as the foremost   writer in modern Hebrew literature has gradually penetrated   linguistic barriers which, in this case, are particularly   obstructive. His most important works are now available in   Swedish under the title\nI havets mitt\n(In the Heart of the   Seas). Agnon, now seventy-eight years old, began writing in   Yiddish but soon changed to Hebrew, which, according to experts,   he handles with absolute mastery, in a taut and sonorous prose   style of extraordinary expressiveness. He was only twenty when he   left his native town in East Galicia, where, as the scion of an   old and respected family, he had been brought up in a scholarly   tradition. He felt drawn to Palestine, where now, as an aged   classical author, he can look back on the long struggle for   national reestablishment, and where the so-called cultural   Zionism possesses in him one of its finest creative   champions.\nAgnon’s unique quality as a writer is apparent chiefly in the   great cycle of novels set in his native town of Buczacz, once a   flourishing centre of Jewish piety and rabbinical learning, now   in ruins.

Born in 1899 in the capital of Guatemala, Asturias became   imbued, even as a child, with the characteristically Guatemalan   love of nature and of the mythical world. He devoted to this   native heritage, and to its libertarian spirit, a fervour which   was to dominate his whole literary production. After studying law   and folklore, he lived in France during the twenties, and, for a   time, represented his country in the diplomatic service. He   condemned himself to a long exile after the anti-democratic coup   d’etat of 1954, but returned when the legitimate regime took   office again. He is presently the Guatemalan Ambassador in   Paris.\nDuring the last few years, Asturias has gained international   recognition, as his most important works came to be translated   into various languages; today they can be read even in Swedish.   His first work was a collection of Guatemalan legends, strange   evocations of the Mayas’ past, a treasure of images and symbols   which has, ever since, been the inexhaustible source of his   inspiration. But he did not get his real start as a writer until   1946, the year of the publication of the novel,\nEl Señor   Presidente\n(The President). This magnificent and tragic   satire criticizes the prototype of the Latin American dictator   who appeared in several places at the beginning of the century   and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the   mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a   hell on earth. The passionate vigour with which Asturias evokes   the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of   the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic   gesture. The narrative, entitled,\nHombres de maíz\n(Men of Maize) appeared three years later. It might be considered   as a folktale whose chief inspiration is in the imagination but   which, nevertheless, remains true to life. Its motifs are from   the mythology of that tropical land where man must struggle   simultaneously against a mysteriously beautiful but hostile   nature and against unbearable social distortions, oppression, and   tyranny. Such an accumulation of nightmares and totemic phantasms   may overwhelm our sensibilities, but we cannot help being   fascinated by a poetry so bizarre and terrifying.\nWith the trilogy of novels begun in 1950 –\nViente Fuerte\n,   1950 (Strong Wind),\nEl Papa verde\n, 1954 (The Green Pope),   and\nLos ojos de los enterrados,\n1960 (The Eyes of the   Buried) – a new topical concern appears in Asturias’s epic work:   the theme of the struggle against the domination of American   trusts, epitomized by the United Fruit Company, and its political   and economic effects upon the contemporary history of the “Banana   Republic”. Here, again, we see the violent effervescence and the   visionary vehemence which stem from the author’s intense   involvement in the situation of his country.\nAsturias has completely freed himself from obsolete narrative   techniques. Very early, he came under the influence of the new   tendencies appearing in European literature; his explosive style   bears a close kinship to French surrealism. It must be noted,   however, that he always takes his inspiration from real life. In   his impressive cycle of poems entitled\nClarivigilia   primaveral\n, 1965 (Bright and Awake in Spring), on which a   Swedish critical study has just appeared, Asturias deals with the   very genesis of the arts and of poetic creation, in a language   which seems to have assumed the bright splendour of the magical   quetzal’s feathers and the glimmering of phosphorescent   insects.\nLatin America today can boast an active group of prominent   writers, a multivoiced chorus in which individual contributions   are not readily discernible. Asturias’s work is nevertheless   vast, bold, and outstanding enough to arouse interest outside of   his own literary milieu, beyond a geographically limited area   situated far away from us. One of the Indian legends Asturias   alludes to evokes the belief that dead ancestors are forced to   witness, with open eyes, the struggles and sufferings of their   offspring. Only when justice is re-established, and the stolen   soil restituted, will the dead finally be able to close their   eyes and sleep peacefully in their tombs. It is a beautiful and   poignant popular belief, and we can easily imagine that the   militant poet has often felt upon him the gaze of his ancestors   and has often heard the silent, symbolic appeal reaching to his   heart.\nMr. Ambassador – you come from a distant country, but do not let   this fact make you feel today that you are a stranger among us.   Your work is known and appreciated in Sweden. We take pleasure in   welcoming you as a messenger from Latin America, its people, its   spirit, and its future. I congratulate you in the name of the   Swedish Academy, which pays tribute to the “vividness of your   literary work, rooted in national traits and Indian traditions”.

At an early age,   however, he was deprived of this favourable growing-up   environment on the sudden death of his parents, and, as an only   child, was sent to his blind and ailing grandfather in a remote   part of the country. These tragic losses, doubly significant in   view of the Japanese people’s intense feeling for blood ties,   have undoubtedly affected Kawabata’s whole outlook on life and   has been one of the reasons for his later study of Buddhist   philosophy.\nAs a student at the imperial university in Tokyo, he decided   early on a writing career, and he is an example of the kind of   restless absorption that is always a condition of the literary   calling. In a youthful short story, which first drew attention to   him at the age of twenty-seven, he tells of a student who, during   lonely autumn walks on the peninsula of Izu, comes across a poor,   despised dancing girl, with whom he has a touching love affair;   she opens her pure heart and shows the young man a way to deep   and genuine feeling. Like a sad refrain in a folksong the theme   recurs with many variations in his following works; he presents   his own scale of values, and with the years, he has won renown   far beyond the borders of Japan. True, of his production only   three novels and a few short stories have so far been translated   into different languages, evidently because translation in this   case offers especially great difficulties and is apt to be far   too coarse a filter, in which many finer shades of meaning in his   richly expressive language must be lost. But the translated works   do give us a sufficiently representative picture of his   personality.\nIn common with his older countryman, Tanizaki, now deceased, he   has admittedly been influenced by modern western realism, but, at   the same time, he has, with greater fidelity, retained his   footing in Japan’s classical literature and therefore represents   a clear tendency to cherish and preserve a genuinely national   tradition of style. In Kawabata’s narrative art it is still   possible to find a sensitively shaded situation poetry which   traces its origin back to Murasaki’s vast canvas of life and   manners in Japan about the year 1000.\nKawabata has been especially praised as a subtle psychologist of   women. He has shown his mastery as such in the two short novels,   “The Snow Kingdom” and “A Thousand Cranes”\n,\nto use the   Swedish titles. In these we see a brilliant capacity to   illuminate the erotic episode, an exquisite keenness of   observation, a whole network of small, mysterious values, which   often put the European narrative technique in the shade.   Kawabata’s writing is reminiscent of Japanese painting; he is a   worshipper of the fragile beauty and melancholy picture language   of existence in the life of nature and in man’s destiny. If the   transience of all outward action can be likened to drifting tufts   of grass on the surface of the water, then it is the genuinely   Japanese miniature art of haiku poetry which is reflected in   Kawabata’s prose style.\nEven if we feel excluded, as it were, from his writing by a root   system, more or less foreign to us, of ancient Japanese ideas and   instincts, we may find it tempting in Kawabata to notice certain   similarities of temperament with European writers from our own   time. Turgeniev is the first to spring to mind, he, too, is a   deeply sensitive storyteller and a broadminded painter of the   social scene, with pessimistically coloured sympathies within a   time of transition between old and new.\nKawabata’s most recent work is also his most outstanding, the   novel, “The Old Capital”\n,\ncompleted six years ago, and now   available in Swedish translation. The story is about the young   girl, Chiëko, a foundling exposed by her poverty-stricken   parents and adopted into the house of the merchant Takichiro,   where she is brought up according to old Japanese principles. She   is a sensitive, loyal being, who, only in secret, broods on the   riddle of her origin. Popular Japanese belief has it that an   exposed child is afflicted with a lifelong curse, in addition to   which the condition of being a twin, according to the strange   Japanese viewpoint, bears the stigma of shame. One day it happens   that she meets a pretty young working girl from a cedar forest   near the city and finds that she is her twin sister. They are   intimately united beyond the social pale of class – the robust,   work-hardened Naëko, and the delicate, anxiously guarded   Chiëko, but their bewildering likeness soon gives rise to   complications and confusion. The whole story is set against the   background of the religious festival year in Kyoto from the   cherry-blossom spring to the snow-glittering winter.\nThe city itself is really the leading character, the capital of   the old kingdom, once the seat of the mikado and his court, still   a romantic sanctuary after a thousand years, the home of the fine   arts and elegant handicraft, nowadays exploited by tourism but   still a loved place of pilgrimage. With its Shinto and Buddha   temples, its old artisan quarters and botanical gardens, the   place possesses a poetry which Kawabata expresses in a tender,   courteous manner, with no sentimental overtones, but, naturally,   as a moving appeal. He has experienced his country’s crushing   defeat and no doubt realizes what the future demands in the way   of industrial go-ahead spirit, tempo and vitality. But in the   postwar wave of violent Americanization, his novel is a gentle   reminder of the necessity of trying to save something of the old   Japan’s beauty and individuality for the new. He describes the   religious ceremonies in Kyoto with the same meticulous care as he   does the textile trade’s choice of patterns in the traditional   sashes belonging to the women’s dresses. These aspects of the   novel may have their documentary worth, but the reader prefers to   dwell on such a deeply characteristic passage as when the party   of middle-class people from the city visits the botanical garden   – which has been closed for a long time because the American   occupation troops have had their barracks there – in order to see   whether the lovely avenue of camphor trees is still intact and   able to delight the connoisseur’s eye.\nWith Kawabata, Japan enters the circle of literary Nobel   Prize-winners for the first time. Essential to the forming of the   decision is the fact that, as a writer, he imparts a   moral-esthetic cultural awareness with unique artistry, thereby,   in his way, contributing to the spiritual bridge-building between   East and West.\nMr Kawabata,\nThe citation speaks of your narrative mastery, which, with great   sensibility, expresses the essence of the Japanese mind. With   great satisfaction we greet you here in our midst today, an   honoured guest from afar, on this platform.

If it is an   Irishman, you will get the paradox into the bargain. Even the   Nobel Prize in Literature is sometimes divided. Paradoxically,   this has happened in 1969, a single award being addressed to one   man, two languages and a third nation, itself divided.\nSamuel Beckett was born near Dublin in 1906. As a renowned author   he entered the world almost half a century later in Paris when,   in the space of three years, five works were published that   immediately brought him into the centre of interest: the novel\nMolloy\nin 1951; its sequel,\nMalone Meurt\n, in the   same year; the play,\nEn Attendant Godot\nin 1952; and in   the following year the two novels,\nL’lnnommable\n, which   concluded the cycle about\nMolloy\nand\nMalone\n, and\nWatt.\nThese dates simply record a sudden appearance. The five works   were not new at the time of publication, nor were they written in   the order in which they appeared. They had their background in   the current situation as well as in Beckett’s previous   development. The true nature of\nMurphy\n, a novel from   1938, and the studies of Joyce   (1929) and Proust (1931), which illuminate his own   initial position, is perhaps most clearly seen in the light of   Beckett’s subsequent production. For while he has pioneered new   modes of expression in fiction and on the stage, Beckett is also   allied to tradition, being closely linked not only to Joyce and   Proust but to Kafka as well, and the dramatic works from his   debut have a heritage from French works of the 1890s and Alfred   Jarry’s\nUbu Roi.\nIn several respects, the novel\nWatt\nmarks a change of   phase in this remarkable output. Written in 1942-44 in the South   of France – whence Beckett fled from the Nazis, having lived for   a long time in Paris – it was to be his last work in English for   many years; he made his name in French and did not return to his   native tongue for about fifteen years. The world around had also   changed when Beckett came to write again after\nWatt.\nAll   the other works which made his name were written in the period   1945-49. The Second World War is their foundation; it was after   this that his authorship achieved maturity and a message. But   these works are not about the war itself, about life at the   front, or in the French resistance movement (in which Beckett   took an active part), but about what happened afterwards, when   peace came and the curtain was rent from the unholiest of   unholies to reveal the terrifying spectacle of the lengths to   which man can go in inhuman degradation – whether ordered or   driven by himself – and how much of such degradation man can   survive. In this sense the degradation of humanity is a recurrent   theme in Beckett’s writing and to this extent, his philosophy,   simply accentuated by elements of the grotesque and of tragic   farce, can be described as a negativism that cannot desist from   descending to the depths. To the depths it must go because it is   only there that pessimistic thought and poetry can work their   miracles. What does one get when a negative is printed? A   positive, a clarification, with black proving to be the light of   day, the parts in deepest shade those which reflect the light   source. Its name is fellow-feeling, charity. There are precedents   besides the accumulation of abominations in Greek tragedy which   led Aristotle to the doctrine of catharsis, purification through   horror. Mankind has drawn more strength from Schopenhauer’s   bitter well than from Schelling’s beatific springs, has been more   blessed by Pascal’s agonized doubt than by Leibniz’s blind   rational trust in the best of all possible worlds has reaped – in   the field of Irish literature, which has also fed Beckett’s   writing – a much leaner harvest from the whitewashed clerical   pastoral of Oliver Goldsmith than from Dean Swift’s vehement   denigration of all humankind.\nPart of the essence of Beckett’s outlook is to be found here – in   the difference between an easily-acquired pessimism that rests   content with untroubled scepticism, and a pessimism that is   dearly bought and which penetrates to mankind’s utter   destitution. The former commences and concludes with the concept   that nothing is really of any value, the latter is based on   exactly the opposite outlook. For what is worthless cannot be   degraded. The perception of human degradation – which we have   witnessed, perhaps, to a greater extent than any previous   generation – is not possible if human values are denied. But the   experience becomes all the more painful as the recognition of   human dignity deepens. This is the source of inner cleansing, the   life force nevertheless, in Beckett’s pessimism. It houses a love   of mankind that grows in understanding as it plumbs further into   the depths of abhorrence, a despair that has to reach the utmost   bounds of suffering to discover that compassion has no bounds.   From that position, in the realms of annihilation, rises the   writing of Samuel Beckett like a miserere from all mankind, its   muffled minor key sounding liberation to the oppressed, and   comfort to those in need.\nThis seems to be stated most clearly in the two masterpieces,\nWaiting for Godot\nand\nHappy Days\n, each of which, in   a way, is a development of a biblical text. In the case of\nGodot\nwe have, ‘Art thou he that should come, or do we   look for another?’ The two tramps are confronted with the   meaninglessness of existence at its most brutal. It may be a   human figure; no laws are as cruel as those of creation and man’s   peculiar status in creation comes from being the only creature to   apply these laws with deliberately evil intent. But if we   conceive of a providence – a source even of the immeasurable   suffering inflicted by, and on, mankind – what sort of almighty   is it that we – like the tramps – are to meet somewhere, some   day? Beckett’s answer consists of the title of the play. By the   end of the performance, as at the end of our own, we know nothing   about this\nGodot.\nAt the final curtain we have no   intimation of the force whose progress we have witnessed. But we   do know one thing, of which all the horror of this experience   cannot deprive us: namely, our waiting. This is man’s   metaphysical predicament of perpetual, uncertain expectation,   captured with true poetic simplicity:\nEn attendant Godot,   Waiting for Godot.\nThe text for\nHappy Days\n– “a voice crying in the   wilderness” – is more concerned with the predicament of man on   earth, of our relationships with one another. In his exposition   Beckett has much to say about our capacity for entertaining   untroubled illusions in a wilderness void of hope. But this is   not the theme. The action simply concerns how isolation, how the   sand rises higher and higher until the individual is completely   buried in loneliness. Out of the suffocating silence, however,   there still rises the head, the voice crying in the wilderness,   man’s indomitable need to seek out his fellow men right to the   end, speak to his peers and find in companionship his solace.\nL’Académie Suédoise regrette que   Samuel Beckett ne soit pas parmi nous aujourd’hui.

According to a current theory this   also applies to authorship. A literary work belongs to its time,   and its creator is a product of his social and political   situation. There are weighty examples to the contrary but these   must be jettisoned or the theory will founder. A case to which it   does apply, however, is this year’s Nobel Prizewinner in   Literature. It is worth emphasizing this because from all points   of the compass, not least the West, people are prone for various   reasons to make exceptions in his case.\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn’s passport – I have in mind the one that   will convey him to posterity – tells us when and where he was   born, details that we need in order to establish his artistic   identity. Born in 1918 in Kislovodsk, he belongs to the first   generation of Soviet Russian writers who grew up with the new   form of government and he is indivisible from the climate and the   time in which he was born. Solzhenitsyn himself has said that he   cannot contemplate living anywhere but in his native land. His   books can; they are already living all round the world, now,   perhaps, more than ever before, in the future, perhaps, more than   now. But their vitality springs not least from the feeling that   roots his being to his country and its destiny. Here, too,   Solzhenitsyn is of the incomparable Russian tradition. The same   background offsets the gigantic predecessors who have derived   from Russia’s suffering the compelling strength and   inextinguishable love that permeate their work. There is little   room in their descriptions for idylls according to plan or   prescribed information about the future. But it would be a gross   misunderstanding of their quest for the truth not to feel in this   their profound decisive identification with the country whose   life provided their subject matter, and for whose life their   works are essential. The central figure in this powerful epic is   the invincible Mother Russia. She appears in various guises under   diverse names. One is Matryona, the main character in one of   Solzhenitsyn’s stories. Her lined face recalls the constant,   indomitable features and re-casts the spell of devotion that she   is able to offer and which she so proudly deserves.\nLove is blind, the saying goes, and if so, it signifies her   instinct for self-preservation. Clear-sighted love does not   always conjure up an immediate response. Time and distance may be   – and have been – necessary for a true appreciation of the depth   and warmth of perceptive feeling. This has not been so in   Solzhenitsyn’s case. When his novel,\nOne Day in the Life of   Ivan Denisovich,\nfirst appeared eight years ago, it was   recognised at once in his own country, and soon all over the   world, that a major new writer had entered the arena. As Pravda   wrote, ‘Solzhenitsyn’s narrative is reminiscent at times of   Tolstoy’s artistic force. An unusually talented author has been   added to our literature!’ It would also be difficult to outdo   Pravda’s exposé of the power exercised by Solzhenitsyn’s   narrative art: ‘Why is it that our heart contracts with pain as   we read this remarkable story at the same time as we feel our   spirits soar? The explanation lies in its profound humanity, in   the quality of mankind even in the hour of degradation.’\nA message about special circumstances seldom travels far and the   words that fly round the world are those which appeal to, and   help us, all. Such are the words of Alexander Solzhenitsyn. They   speak to us of matters that we need to hear more than ever   before, of the individual’s indestructible dignity. Wherever that   dignity is violated, whatever the reason or the means, his   message is not only an accusation but also an assurance: those   who commit such a violation are the only ones to be degraded by   it. The truth of this is plain to see wherever one travels.\nEven the external form which Solzhenitsyn seeks for his work   bears witness to his message. This form has been termed the   polyphone or horizontal novel. It might equally be described as a   story with no chief character. Which is to say that this is not   individualism at the expense of the surroundings. But nor may the   gallery of persons act as a collective that smothers the   individuals of which it is entirely composed. Solzhenitsyn has   explained what he means by polyphonism: each person becomes the   chief character whenever the action concerns him. This is not   just a technique, it is a creed. The narrative focuses on the   only human element in existence, the human individual, with equal   status among equals, one destiny among millions and a million   destinies in one. This is the whole of humanism in a nutshell,   for the kernel is love of mankind. This year’s Nobel Prize for   Literature has been awarded to the proclaimer of such a   humanism.\nFrom\nLes Prix Nobel\nen 1970\n, Editor Wilhelm Odelberg, [Nobel Foundation], Stockholm, 1971\nAddress to Alexandr Solzhenitsyn by Karl   Ragnar Gierow, of the Swedish Academy, on December 10, 1971\nAt the presentation of the Nobel prizes on   10 December 1970 I was charged by the Swedish Academy briefly to   introduce the Nobel prizewinner in literature. I did so in the\nfollowing words\n, which I now beg you to   have a few minutes’ patience with.\nAs Alexander Solzhenitsyn could not be   present at the prizegiving, I have now come here to give him his   insignia.\nI come alone but with open arms.\nFor this in the very way that shows most   clearly what the Nobel prize is intended to mean.\nIt is\nnot\na gesture of courtesy from   one nation to another.\nIt is an award to an individual man for his   own work, made by an academy which reaches its decisions without   consulting anyone else.\nBut above all, the ceremony that I am   attending here emphasizes the very nature of the dignity with   which the Nobel prize can be associated.\nThat dignity belongs to the recipient.\nWhat prestige and importance the Nobel   prize possesses, it has gained through the prizewinners. Their   achievement it is which makes the mark of honour something other   than a sum of money and a couple of objects.\nAlfred Nobel’s intention was, that what   mankind accomplishes in its best moments through its finest   efforts, shall also benefit humanity all over the world, without   respect to nation, language, race or creed.\nTo that extent the goal of which Nobel   dreamed can be said to be that which is happening here at this   moment.\nIf there is something we have the right to   wish for, it is that every gathering should take the form of this   one: a trusting fellowship between free people who, without fear,   desire each other’s good.\nThat is the hope, for the moment realized,   which must never be dashed. That is the demand which our earth   cannot afford to give up.\nThat is the significance of the ceremony   taking place here.\nDear Alexander Solzhenitsyn, when I now   hand over your Nobel diploma and your Nobel medal, I not only   express the hearty congratulations and warm admiration of the   Swedish Academy and the Nobel Foundation.\nI also convey our deep gratitude for the   dignity and honour which your works confer upon the prize for   which the Swedish Academy is responsible.\nFrom\nLes Prix Nobel\nen 1970\n, Editor Wilhelm Odelberg, [Nobel Foundation], Stockholm, 1971\nAddress to Alexandr Solzhenitsyn by Karl   Ragnar Gierow, of the Swedish Academy, on December 10, 1974\nNot only for the Swedish Academy but for   all of us the ceremony today has its particular significance: we   can, finally, hand over to the laureate of 1970 the insignia of   his award.\nMr Alexander Solzhenitsyn: I have already   made two speeches to you. The first one you couldn’t listen   to, because there was a frontier to cross. The second one I   couldn’t deliver, because there was a frontier to cross.   Your presence here today doesn’t mean that the frontiers   have at last been abolished. On the contrary, it means that you   are now on this side of a border that still exists. But the   spirit of your writings, as I understand it, the driving force of   your work, like the spirit and force of Alfred Nobel’s last   will and testament, is to open all frontiers, to enable man to   meet man, freely and confidently.\nThe difficulty is that such a confidence   can only be built on truth. And nowhere in this world of ours is   truth always greeted with pure pleasure. Truth goes from house to   house, and the dog barks at whom he does not know, says a stern   old philosopher. But all the more happy and grateful are those   who recognize the wandering stranger and ask him to spend the   night and his life with them, in the deep, even desperate hope   that the day may not be far off when a frontier is, as it should   be, merely a line on the map, which we pass on our way to   friends. Such should be, and could be, the case all around the   prospering and tormented planet which we inhabit.\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn, my dear friend,   with these few words I convey to you the warm congratulations of   the Swedish Academy and ask you to receive from the hands of His   Majesty the King the insignia of the prize to whose value you   have added your honour.\nFrom\n, Literature 1968-1980\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

It is the Nobel Prize that gains lustre from the recipient – provided the right one has been chosen. But who is the right one? According to Nobel’s will, as we have just heard, the prize is to reward work in “an ideal direction”. This is not pure Swedish. One may work under conditions that are not ideal. One can, according to the presumption made by Oscar Wilde, be an ideal husband. The word ideal simply indicates something that corresponds to reasonable expectations. But that is not enough for a Nobel prize. In Nobel’s time the word still had philosophical connotations as well. By ideal was meant something which only exists in one’s imagination, never in the world of the senses. This is perhaps true of the ideal husband, but not of the ideal Nobel prize winner.\nThe spirit of Nobel’s will tells us what he had in mind. The contribution must be one which will benefit mankind. But any work of art worthy of the name does this, so does any literary work with a serious purpose, and so far that matter does that which aims at nothing more serious than raising a healthy laugh. The clause in the will has so much to say that it leaves us without a clear message. One of the few cases, however, where it does take on a definite meaning is this year’s winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature: Pablo Neruda. His work benefits mankind precisely because of its direction. It is my impossible task here to indicate this in a few words. To sum up, Neruda is like catching a condor with a butterfly net. Neruda, in a nutshell, is an unreasonable proposition: the kernel bursts the shell.\nNevertheless, one can do something to describe this kernel. What Neruda has achieved in his writing is community with existence. This sounds simple, and is perhaps our most difficult problem. He himself, in one of his\nNew Elemental Odes\n, has defined it in the formula: harmony with Man and the Earth. The direction in his work, the direction which can so justly be called ideal, is indicated by the path which has brought him to this harmony. His starting point was isolation and dissonance.\nSo it was in the love poems of his youth. What these\nTwenty Poems of Love and One Ode of Desperation\ndepict is the meeting between two people’s desolation in the shadow of destruction, and in the next major work,\nResidence on Earth\n, he is still “alone among shifting matter”.\nThe turning point was reached in Spain. It was as if a release from the shadow of death and a way towards fellowship were opened when he saw friends and fellow writers taken away in fetters and executed. He found the fellowship of the oppressed and persecuted. He found it when he returned from the Spain of the Civil War to his own country, the battleground for conquistadors over the centuries. But out of the fellowship with this territory of terror there grew, too, awareness of its riches, pride over its past, and hope for its future, for that which he saw shimmering like a mirage far to the East. With this, Neruda’s work was transformed into the poetry of political and social preparedness under the banner of redress and visions of the future – not least so in Canto general, partly written while in exile in his own country for no other offence than an opinion. The opinion was that his country belonged to him and his compatriots and that no man’s dignity should be insulted.\nThis huge collection is no more than a drop in Neruda’s brimming output. In his work a continent awakens to consciousness. To require moderation in such an inspiration is as if to demand system and order from a jungle and restraint from a volcano.\nThe fact that Neruda’s\nœuvre\nis so difficult to view as a whole may also make it difficult to recognize what distances he has put behind him. One of his later collections of poems is called\nEstravagario\n. The word seems to be a new one and comprises both extravagance and vagabondage, whim and errantry. For the way from\nCanto general\nwas still long and full of experiences, enriching or bitter. The territory of terror was found to lie in more than one part of the globe and Neruda saw this with the indignation of one who feels himself duped. The erstwhile idol who was set up everywhere in “the stucco statutes of a moustachioed god in boots” now appeared in an ever more merciless light, as did the similarity in methods and trappings between the two leader figures whom he called just Moustache and Little Moustache. But at the same time Neruda was also led to a new relationship to Love and to Woman, to the origin and continuance of life, perhaps most beautifully expressed in yet another masterpiece from recent years,\nLa Barcarola\n. Whither Neruda’s path will take him now, it is not for anyone to say. But the direction is the one already set, harmony with Man and the Earth, and we shall follow with high expectations this remarkable poetry, which with the overflowing vitality of an awakening continent resembles one of its rivers, growing all the mightier and more majestic the closer it approaches the estuary and the sea.\nCher Maitre,\nVotre Estravagario vous a mené loin à travers des pays et des époques. Une fois il vous a mené vers une cité minière où les mineurs avaient peint un hommage sur cette terre qui est vraiment la vôtre. Il disait: Bienvenue à Neruda.

Votre tour du monde vous a aujourd’hui mené ici: dans la ville aux clochers vert-de-grisés que vous chantâtes une fois. Et je répète le même hommage: Bienvenido Neruda.

Through these writings –   begun twenty years ago and culminating in last year’s novel\nGruppenbild mit Dame\n– there runs, however, a twin theme   that might serve as such a synoptic abstraction. This could be   phrased: The homeless and the aesthetics of the humane. But   Böll’s homeless are not ill-fated individuals or human   wreckage cast up outside the bulwarks of society. He tells of a   society without a roof over its head, a derailed, displaced   epoch, standing on every street corner with hand outstretched,   begging for the charity of a kindred spirit and human fellowship.   This is the situation underlying Böll’s\nÄsthetik des Humanen\n.\nHe writes about what every human being   seeks in order to lead a human life, in little things as in   great, about “das Wohnen, die Nachbarschaft und die Heimat,   das Geld und die Liebe, Religion und Mahlzeiten”, to quote   his own enumeration. With its whole register from satire and   high-spirited parody to deep suffering, this is a form of   passionately engaged aesthetics and it also contains his literary   program. He who sets out to portray the bare necessities of life   keeps both feet on the ground.\nYet Böll has declared “Ich   brauche wenig Wirklichkeit”, a word to note, coming from   one who is regarded and who perhaps regards himself as a   realistic narrator. The reality he needs so little is that of the   classic 19th century novel, the reality that after a meticulous   study of detail is faithfully reproduced. Böll is highly   proficient at the method but employs it ironically; there is no   limit to the superfluity of detail.\nBut the jesting with this conscientious   form of registration is itself a demonstration of how little   Böll needs such a reality. His mastery includes the ability   to bring his setting and its figures to life with scanty,   sometimes barely suggested lines.\nThere is however another reality which   Böll’s writing continually requires: the background to   his existence, the air his generation breathed, the heritage into   which it came. That reality is the recurrent, intrusively   observed subject of Heinrich Böll’s writing, from the   start up to the magnum opus already mentioned,\nGruppenbild mit   Dame\n, which so far crowns his work. Böll’s real   breakthrough came in the years 1953, 1954 and 1955 with three   novels published one after the other –\nUnd sagte kein einziges   Wort; Haus ohne Hüter\n, and\nDas Brot der frühen   Jahre\n. Although it was presumably not the author’s   intention, these three titles serve to indicate the reality which   he so persistently and forcefully depicts. His background was   Germany’s years of famine, it was\nDas Brot der   frühen Jahre\n, the bread that never sufficed and often   was not there, the bread that had to be begged for or stolen if   one was to survive, and that diet is an indelible memory. The   heritage which he and his contemporaries had to administer was\nHaus ohne Hüter\n, house without caretaker, an   existence in ruins, with time a widow and the future fatherless.   The air he and his contemporaries breathed was inhaled with the   heavy hand of dictatorship on their throats,\nUnd sagte kein   einziges Wort\n, because the hand smothered every sound.\nIt is not the smallest German miracle that   after such years of destitution a new generation of writers,   thinkers and researchers was ready so soon to shoulder their   country’s and their own essential task in the spiritual   life of our time. The renewal of German literature, to which   Heinrich Boll’s achievements witness and of which they are   a significant part, is not an experiment with form – a drowning   man scorns the butterfly stroke. Instead it is a rebirth out of   annihilation, a resurrection, a culture which, ravaged by icy   nights and condemned to extinction, sends up new shoots, blossoms   and matures to the joy and benefit of us all. Such was the kind   of work Alfred Nobel wished his Prize to reward.\nDear Mr. Böll,\nAs a given consequence of the homelessness that is one of the   main themes of your writing, comes the striving that you yourself   have indicated with the words: “Die Suche nach einer   bewohnbaren Sprache in einem bewohnbaren Land”. This   implies an antithesis of homelessness, a writing in which   everyone can feel at home. You reject a literature for an   initiated circle, you have declared, adding significantly:   “Eine Kirche wird eingeweiht, aber durch diesen Akt der   Einweihung nicht geschlossen, sondern geoffnet”. It is this   openness for the human aspect which gives space and raises the   arches higher in your works. And it is works in that spirit which   give us a certain right to set our hopes as well on a habitable   world. With these words I express the congratulations of the   Swedish Academy and ask you now to receive this year’s   Nobel Prize for Literature from the hands of His Royal Highness   the Crown Prince.\nFrom\n, Literature 1968-1980\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

In the – as always – brief citation, mention is made of   “his epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a   new continent into literature”. These words have been somewhat   misunderstood in certain quarters. They are only intended to   emphasize the prominent position occupied by Patrick White in the   literature of his country: they should not be taken to deny the   existence of an important body of Australian literature apart   from his writings.\nIn fact a long succession of authors have   endowed Australian literature with an independence and a   character which are unmistakably Australian and by virtue of   which that literature has long deserved to be regarded in the   eyes of the world as something more than an extension of the   English tradition. It will be sufficient here to mention such   names as Henry Lawson and Henry Handel Richardson. Lawson was the   son of an immigrant Norwegian seaman by the name of Larsen, and   in his short stories he gave authentic expression to various   types of down-to-earth Australian experience. The authoress   writing under the name of Henry Handel Richardson achieved in her   most important sequence of novels an authentic and grandiose   memorial to her father as the exponent of a lingering British way   of life in Australia. Nor should one neglect a number of   ambitious but somewhat recondite poets who have heightened   Australian awareness and intensified the expressive powers of   their language.\nFor all his originality, there is no   denying that the work of Patrick White displays certain typical   features of Australian literature generally sharing with it the   background, natural history and ways of life of the country. It   is also well known that White stands in close relation to   advanced Australian pictorial artists such as Sidney Nolan,   Arthur Boyd and Russel Drysdale, who with the means at their   disposal aim at something of the same expressiveness as he sets   out to achieve in his writing. Also it is an encouraging sign   that White’s influence has gradually made itself felt and that   several of the most promising young writers are to be seen as his   successors in one way or another.\nAt the same time, however, it should be   emphasized that White is less preoccupied than some of his   representative colleagues with things specifically Australian.   Although most of his novels are set against an Australian   background, his main concern has been to depict people whose   problems and living situations are highly individualized,   transcending the local and the national. Even in his most   typically Australian epic,\nThe Tree of Man\n, in which an   important part is played by nature and society, his principal aim   has been to portray his characters from the inside, to make them   come alive not so much in terms of typical or atypical settler   careers as in the guise of unique individuals. And when he   accompanies his explorer Voss into the wilderness of the   continent, that wilderness becomes first and foremost a dramatic   scenario for the obsession and self-sacrifice of a Nietzschean   willpower.\nOne is struck by the frequency with which   Patrick White has made his main characters to a greater or lesser   degree outsiders in relation to society: aliens, maladjusted or   retarded people and quite often mystics and zealots. It is as   though in these people, destitute and vulnerable as they are, he   found it easiest to discern the human qualities which fascinate   him. This is the case with the characters of\nRiders in the   Chariot\n, whose alien status or deviation brings them   persecution and suffering but who in a mystical way are also the   elect, victorious in their misfortune. It is also the case with   the two brothers in\nThe Solid Mandala\n, with their   contradictory characters: the well-adjusted but spiritually   barren and the clumsy but intuitively percipient. In a way it is   also true of the all-pervading principal characters in White’s   two latest and largest novels: the artist in\nThe   Vivisector\nand the old woman in\nThe Eye of the Storm\n.   In the artist the creative urge is portrayed as a species of   curse, as a result of which his art becomes an all-consuming   effort of which both its practitioner and the people close to him   become the victims. In the old woman the author has taken the   experience of a cyclone as the mystical centre from which an   insight radiates to shed light on her life, with its many   misadventures, right up to the moment of her death.\nPatrick White is a rather difficult author   not only because of his special ideas and problems but also   perhaps no less due to his unusual combination of epic and poetic   qualities. In his broad narrative he uses a highly compressed   language, a verbal art worked out to the last detail and   constantly aiming for a maximum of expressive effect, a   relentless intensification or a subtle penetration. Here beauty   and truth are closely allied or completely fused together: a   beauty radiating light and life, evoking the poetry inherent in   things, in nature and in all manner of phenomena, and truth which   exposes and liberates, even though at first it may seem repugnant   or frightening.\nPatrick White is a social critic mainly   through his depiction of human beings, as befits a true novelist.   He is first and foremost a bold psychological explorer, at the   same time as he readily refers to ideological views of life or   mystical convictions to elicit the support and the uplifting   message which they have to offer. His relationship to himself,   like his relationship to his fellow beings, is complex and full   of contradictions. Exalted demands are thrown into sharp relief   against emphatic denials. Passion and longing are confronted by a   distinct puritanism. In contradistinction to what may be pride in   himself he glorifies humility and humiliation, a persistent   feeling of guilt that demands atonement and sacrifice. He is   constantly assailed by doubts concerning the capacity of thought   and art, even though he is indefatigable in his high-minded   pursuit of both these things.\nPatrick White’s literary art has spread his   fame throughout the world and he now ranks as Australia’s   foremost representative in his field. His creative work,   performed in solitude and doubtless in the teeth of considerable   opposition, in various kinds of adversity, has gradually yielded   lasting and progressively more widely acknowledged results, in   spite of the doubts he himself may have had concerning the value   of his efforts. The controversial side of Patrick White is   connected with the extreme tension of his self-expression, with   his assault on the most difficult problems: the very qualities   that constitute his indisputable greatness. Without those   qualities he would be unable to bestow the consolation now   present in the very midst of his gloom: the conviction that there   must be something more worth living for than our onward rushing   civilization seems to offer.\nThe Swedish Academy regrets that Patrick   White is not here to-day. But as his representative we greet one   of his best friends, the excellent Australian artist Sidney   Nolan. And now I beg you, Mr. Nolan, to receive the Nobel Prize   for Literature, awarded to Patrick White, from the hands of His   Majesty the King.\nFrom\n, Literature 1968-1980\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The future awaiting the young Harry Martinson opened up   to him when, at the age of six, as a so-called child of the   parish, he was sold by auction to the lowest bidder – that is, to   the person who took charge of the forsaken boy for the smallest   payment out of parochial funds. The fact that, with such a start   in life, both of them have their places on this platform today,   is the visible testimony to a transformation of society, which,   step by step, is still going on all over the world. With us it   came unusually early; it is perhaps our country’s biggest   blessing, perhaps, also, its most remarkable achievement during   the last thousand years.\nEyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson did not come alone, nor first.   They are representative of the many proletarian writers or   working-class poets who, on a wide front, broke into our   literature, not to ravage and plunder, but to enrich it with   their fortunes. Their arrival meant an influx of experience and   creative energy, the value of which can hardly be exaggerated. To   that extent they are representative also of the similar   breakthrough that has later occurred in the whole of our cultural   world. A new class has conquered Parnassus. But if, by a   conqueror, we mean the one who gained most from the outcome, then   Parnassus has conquered a new class.\nTo determine an author and his work against the background of his   social origin and political environment is, at present, good   form. And what is good form is seldom particularly to the point.   “Eyvind Johnson’s literary achievement is one of the most   significant and characteristic of a very fruitful period in the   whole of Europe.” This last sentence is not mine; it was written   thirty years ago by Lucien Maury. Even then, the boy from a   primary school in a remote village in the far north of Sweden was   an experienced and self-assured European, never forgetful of his   origin (of which his autobiographical stories provide a lasting   document), but still less bound and inhibited by the environment   where he took his first steps. International perspective   distinguished Eyvind Johnson’s further writings, and it is   matched by an equally wide outlook in time, over the destinies   and ages of the human race. The renewal of the historical novel   which he has carried out on his own, and perhaps exemplified most   clearly in great works like\nDays of His Grace\nand\nSteps   Towards Silence\n, is based not only on extensive research but   also on a clear-sightedness which, expressed briefly, sets out to   show that everything that happens to us has happened before, and   everything that took place once in the world is still taking   place, recognizable under changed signs, a constant simultaneity   of epochs which may be the only wisdom the past can teach us in   our attempts to survey the present and divine an era which we   have not yet seen.\nIf, nevertheless, we are to point to a special phase and one   particular mental environment whose traces are ineffaceable in   Eyvind Johnson’s work with his pen, it is that very period when   Lucien Maury discovered that in this Nordic writer, Europe had   one of its important intellectuals. The French time analyst   described this epoch as very fruitful. What was it that made it   so productive? Not favourable conditions, but the indomitable   resistance to the conditions that prevailed. D-day had not yet   dawned; Nazism still had a stranglehold on Europe. It was in that   predicament that Eyvind Johnson spoke out. His attitude was so   passionate that its fervour has never since vanished from what he   wrote. He retained his European perspective, but, naturally, it   was Scandinavia’s liberty that was dearest to him just then. He   endorsed his conviction with a handshake across the border.   Together with a co-editor on the Norwegian side he was   responsible during the occupation years for a mouthpiece of the   new Scandinavianism, called – “A Handshake”. As from today the   two publishers of that little paper are both Nobel Prizewinners.   The name of Eyvind Johnson’s co-editor on the Norwegian side of   the frontier was\nWilly   Brandt\n.\nBoth Eyvind Johnson and, still more, Harry Martinson have a lot   in common with the oldest, and perhaps, greatest of all   proletarian writers, the subtly wise and charming author of   ingenious fables, Aesop. Like him, they spin webs, capturing you   with beguiling words that always contain other, and more, than   what they literally say. But the differences between this year’s   two literary prizewinners are greater than the similarities.   Beside Eyvind Johnson, whose writing is based so very much on his   fiercely defended citizenship in a free society, Harry Martinson   may appear to be almost a purely asocial individual, the   incorrigible vagrant in our literature. No one has succeeded in   putting him under lock and key. The philosophic tramp, Bolle, in\nThe Road\nis, in many ways, the author’s spokesman, and he   is not homeless at the gate. He is homeless only when he gets   inside four walls. He is the bearer of asocialism as a wish and a   principle that brings good luck; he is a vagabond of his own free   will, in agreement with life’s sound instincts and in spontaneous   revolt against what is trying to stifle them – that which is   governed by calculation and established by force. He already has   his home; it is beyond and outside, and he is always on the way   towards it. From this starting point, though in a different key,   we can also conceive the tragically beautiful vision of Aniara,   of the spaceship which heads away from an increasingly hostile   existence on a frozen earth and itself loses its rudder, cut off   from its home port and with its destination lost.\n“I don’t want to have real that most people want to have real”,   Bolle remarks. In saying this he has also said quite a lot about   Harry Martinson’s writing. Realism is to be found there to the   extent that it can be called elemental: it is based on the   closest familiarity with the four elements. Harry Martinson got   to know earth and air as a tramp on the roads, fire and water as   a stoker at sea. Yet the world of imagination is more important   and more real to him than that of reality. Where realism plods   methodically along, his imagination races with the swallow-winged   glide of the skater. However, it is not a flight from truth; on   the contrary. “We must learn the essential difference between   what is factual and what is truth”, he has said. “We have facts   everywhere. They whirl in our eyes like sand.” But it is truth we   are concerned with, and that is something else. It is a state in   nature and in the receptive human being; it is\nthe good will with presence and peace of     mind\nto keep watch and to be.\nFor Harry Martinson fact and fiction are   one, and, without any aphoristic hair-splitting, an entire   outlook on life is summed up in these pregnant words. The last   two, most emphasized, form the simple verb of mere existence: to   be. But existence is only fit for human beings if it gives them   pleasure, and for that, good will and vigilance are needed. So,   in the end, the truth to which this wanderer’s path has led him   is a gratitude, round-eyed as a child’s, for the generous life   that has constantly given him trials, riddles and joy in good   measure.\nAfter this quickly cut-out silhouette of two remarkable literary   profiles, it is my very pleasant duty to express the heartfelt   congratulations of the Swedish Academy to Eyvind Johnson and   Harry Martinson and to ask them to receive the emblems of the   1974 Nobel Prize for Literature from the hands of His Majesty,   the King.\nFrom\nLes Prix Nobel\nen 1974\n, Editor Wilhelm Odelberg, [Nobel Foundation], Stockholm, 1975\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

He   comes from Eastern Liguria, a coastal landscape whose harsh   character is reflected in his poetry. In this there echoes   through the years a musical surge of waves which confronts his   own destiny with the stern and beauteous majesty of the   Mediterranean. Montale’s famous first book from 1925 bears too   the strange title\nOssi di seppia\n, which means “Bones of   the Cuttlefish” and clearly emphasizes his distinctive Ligurian   character.\nAt the outset of his career he encountered   the fascist dictatorship’s atmosphere of suppression of free   speech and enforced standardization. Montale refused to write to   order and therefore came to belong to the picked troop of free   authors who, in spite of everything, managed to hold their own   under cover of the so-called hermeticism. His personality was   hardened by bitter experience. He served in the first world war   as an infantry officer in the Tyrolean Alps, and later became   head of the famous Vieusseux Library in Florence. In 1939 he was   abruptly dismissed; not having a fascist party membership card he   could not be regarded as an Italian citizen. Not until 1948 was   he appointed an editor of\nCorriere della sera\n, the big   Milan newspaper, in which for many years he has made a name for   himself as an outstanding writer on cultural matters and as a   music critic.\nMontale has slowly confirmed his key   position in Italy’s modern literature during this epoch, in many   ways so tragic for his native land. To a great extent he can be   said to represent this sombre awareness, which seeks individual   expression of collective sorrows and troubles. As a poet he   interprets this awareness with calm dignity and without any   political publicity. He has also gained a seriously listening   audience, a fact remarkable in that his lyrical writing is   restricted to five books of poems at long intervals. The foremost   work is undoubtedly\nLa bufera e altro\n(“The Storm and   Other Things”), which was published in 1956. Nor does his   reserved and thoughtful temperament court popularity.\nMontale himself once stated that as an   Italian he wanted before anything else to “wring the neck of   eloquence in the old rhetorical language, even at the risk of   finding himself in an anti-eloquence”. Actually he has gladly   taken that risk, and his latest book of poems,\nDiario\n, a   diary from the years 1971 to 1972 consists largely of ironic   remarks and epigrams in which the ageing poet lets himself go and   criticizes contemporary reality with an almost anti-poetic   tendency. His winged horse is a fairly restless spirit, which   refuses to stand still docilely in the stall of honour.\nBut at his best Montale, with strict   discipline, has attained a refined artistry, at once personal and   objective, in which every word fills its place as precisely as   the glass cube in a coloured mosaic. The linguistic laconicism   cannot be carried any further; every trace of embellishment and   jingle has been cleared away. When, for instance, in the   remarkable portrait-poem of the Jewes Dora Markus, he wants to   indicate the current background of time, he does so in five   words:\nDistilla veleno una fede feroce\n(“A fierce faith   distils poison”). In such masterpieces both the fateful   perspective and the ingeniously concentrated structure are   reminiscent of T.S. Eliot and “The Waste Land”, but Montale is   unlikely to have received impulses from this quarter and his   development has, if anything, followed a parallel path.\nDuring the half-century in which he has   worked, Montale’s attitude can be summed up as a fundamental   pessimism on the classical line from Leopardi. This pessimism is   seldom purely emotional, but manifests itself as a deeply mature,   rational insight retaining the critical right both to ask and   defy. His conviction is that poor humanity is slipping downhill,   that the lessons of history have little value, and that world   destitution is going from bad to worse. When he surveys the   present juncture he finds that the real evil lies in the fact   that the scale of values of another age can be completely lost;   in other words, the memory of the great spirits of the past in   their striving to build up something which enables us to create   another picture of our earthly existence and its conditions.\nBut his resignation does contain a spark of   confidence in life’s instinct to go on, to overcome the   accumulated obstacles. Montale would not be the born poet he is,   if he did not believe deep down that poetry – without being a   mass medium – even in our time is still a gentle power which,   unperceived, can act as one of the voices of human conscience,   faintly heard admittedly, but indestructible and   indispensable.\nDear Mr Montale! In the all too brief time   at my disposal I have tried to present your poetry and to justify   our award. It only remains for me now to express the heartfelt   congratulations of the Swedish Academy and to ask you to receive   this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature from the hands of His   Majesty the King.\nFrom\n, Literature 1968-1980\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The so-called hard-boiled style, with its   virile air and choppy prose, had now slackened into an everyday   routine, which was pounded out automatically; its rigid paucity   of words left not only much unsaid but also most of it unfelt,   unexperienced. Bellow’s first work,\nDangling Man\n(1944),   was one of the signs portending that something else was at   hand.\nIn Bellow’s case emancipation from the   previous ideal style took place in two stages. In the first he   reached back to the kind of perception that had found its already   classic guides in Maupassant, Henry James and Flaubert perhaps   most of all. The masters he followed expressed themselves as   restrainedly as those he turned his back on. But the emphasis was   elsewhere. What gave a story its interest was not the dramatic,   sometimes violent action but the light it shed over the   protagonist’s inner self. With that outlook the novel’s heroes   and heroines could be regarded, seen through and exposed, but not   glorified. The anti-hero of the present was already on the way,   and Bellow became one of those who took care of him.\nDangling Man\n, the man without a   foothold, was thus a significant watchword to Bellow’s writing   and has to no small extent remained so. He pursued the line in   his next novel,\nThe Victim\n(1947) and, years later, with   mature mastery in\nSeize the Day\n(1956). With its exemplary   command of subject and form the last-mentioned novel has received   the accolade as one of the classic works of our time.\nBut with the third story in this   stylistically coherent suite, it is as if Bellow had turned back   in order at last to complete something which he himself had   already passed. With his second stage, the decisive step, he had   already left this school behind him, whose disciplined form and   enclosed structure gave no play to the resources of exuberant   ideas, flashing irony, hilarious comedy and discerning compassion   which he also knew he possessed and whose scope he must try out.   The result was something quite new, Bellow’s own mixture of rich   picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of   entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick   succession, interspersed with philosophic conversation with the   reader-that too very entertaining-all developed by a commentator   with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and   inner complications that drive us to act or prevent us from   acting and that can be called the dilemma of our age.\nFirst in the new phase came\nThe   Adventures of Augie March\n(1953). The very wording of the   title points straight to the picaresque, and the connexion is   perhaps most strongly in evidence in this novel. But here Bellow   had found his style, and the tone recurs in the following series   of novels that form the bulk of his work:\nHenderson the Rain   King\n(1959),\nHerzog\n(1964),\nMr Samler’s Planet\n(1970) and\nHumboldt’s Gift\n(1975). The structure is   apparently loose-jointed but for this very reason gives the   author ample opportunity for descriptions of different societies;   they have a rare vigour and stringency and a swarm of colourful,   clearly defined characters against a background of carefully   observed and depicted settings, whether it is the magnificent   facades of Manhattan in front of the backyards of the slums and   semi-slums, Chicago’s impenetrable jungle of resourceful   businessmen intimately intertwined with obliging criminal gangs,   or the more literal jungle, in the depths of Africa, where the   novel,\nHenderson the Rain King\n, the writer’s most   imaginative expedition, takes place. In a nutshell they are all   stories on the move and, like the first book, are about a man   with no foothold, but (and it is important to add this) a man who   keeps on\ntrying to find\na foothold during his wanderings   in our tottering world.\nEven a few minutes’ sketch of Bellow’s   many-sided writings should indicate where that foothold lies. It   cannot be pointed out, as none of his protagonists reaches it.   But during their escapades they are all on the run, not\nfrom\nsomething but\ntowards\nsomething, a goal   somewhere which will give them what they lack – firm ground under   their feet. “I want, I want, I want!” Henderson exclaims, and   sets off for an unknown continent. What his demands are he does   not know; what he demands is to find out, and his own desire is   the unknown continent. “A worthwhile fate,” Augie March calls his   goal. And Herzog, the restless seeker after truth, for his part   tries out one phrasing after the other of what he means by “a   worthwhile fate”. At one point he says confidently that “the   realm of facts and that of value are not eternally separated”.   The words are uttered in passing but are worth dwelling on, and   if we think of them as coming from Bellow himself they are   essential. Giving value a place side by side with palpable facts   is, as regards literature, a definite departure from realism. As   a philosophy it is a protest against the determinism that must   make man unaccountable for his actions as well as inert or   hostile to life, since it prevents him from feeling, choosing and   acting himself. The awareness of a value, on the other hand,   gives man freedom, thereby responsibility, thereby a desire for   action and a faith in the future. That is why Bellow, never one   to look through rose-coloured spectacles, is at heart an   optimist. It is the light of that conviction which makes the   facets of his writing sparkle. His “anti-heroes” are victims of   constant disappointment, born to defeat without end, and Bellow   (it cannot be over-emphasized) loves and is able to transform the   fate they find worthwhile into superb comedies. But they triumph   nonetheless, they are heroes nonetheless, since they never give   up the realm of values in which man becomes human. And, as Augie   March says, anyone can become alive to this fact at any moment,   however unfortunate he may be, “if he will be quiet and wait it   out”.\nThe realm of facts and that of value – the   very combination of words is reminiscent of a work by the   philosopher Wolfgang Köhler, professor first at   Göttingen, then in Berlin, finally at Princeton, to which he   fled from the Nazis. Köhler’s book is called\nThe Place of   Value in a World of Facts\nand lent its name to an   international Nobel symposium in Stockholm some years ago, at   which a lecture was given by E. H. Gombrich, disciple and younger   friend of Köhler. He told of the latter’s last night in   Berlin, before the flight could be carried out. Köhler spent   the slow hours with like-minded friends, and while they waited,   wondering if a patrol would clamp up the stairs at the last   moment and pound on the door with rifle butts, they played   chamber music. “Such is,” Gombrich remarked, “the place of value   in a world of facts”.\nThe threatened position of value between   obtrusive realities has not escaped Bellow; that is what he is   always writing about. But he does not think that either mankind’s   conduct or the explosive development of the sciences betoken a   world catastrophe. He is an optimist-in-spite-of-all, and thus   also an opposition leader of human kindness. Truth must out, of   course. But it is not always hostile. Facing the truth is not   necessarily the same as braving death. “There may be truths on   the side of life,” he has said. “There may be some truths which   are, after all, our friends in the universe.”\nIn an interview once Bellow described   something of what happens when he writes. Most of us, he   supposed, have a primitive prompter or commentator within, who   from earliest years has been telling us what the real world is.   He himself has such a commentator in him; he has to prepare the   ground for him and take notice of what he says. One is put in   mind of another man who went out into the highways and byways   with his questions, taking notice of his inner voice : Socrates   and his daemon. This introspective listening demands seclusion.   As Bellow himself puts it, “Art has something to do with the   achievement of stillness in the midst of chaos. A stillness which   characterizes prayer, too, and the eye of the storm.” This was   what prevailed when Köhler played chamber music on his last   night in Berlin while, aware of imminent disaster, “being quiet   and waiting it out”. It is there that the value and dignity of   life and mankind have their sole haven, ever storm-lashed, and it   is from that stillness that Saul Bellow’s work, borne on the   whirlwind of disquiet, derives its inspiration and strength.\nDear Mr Bellow, it is my task and my great   pleasure to convey to you the warm congratulations of the Swedish   Academy and to ask you to receive from the hands of His Majesty   the King the Nobel Prize for Literature of the year 1976.\nFrom\n, Literature 1968-1980\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The latter may be due to the former. For even his devoted admirers offer varying interpretations of his poetry. It is doubtful if anyone has yet been able to sum it up properly, one reason being that fifty years after Aleixandre’s debut his writing still seems to be forging ahead. His two most remarkable collections of poems, the twin crowns of his career to date, appeared in 1968 (\nPoemas de la consumación\n) and 1974 (\nDiálogos del conocimiento\n).\nOn one point, however, all are agreed: Aleixandre’s place and importance in the spiritual life of Spain. In the history of literature he is part of the current that broke into Spanish poetry in the 1920s with unequalled breadth and force. One of the names of the vigorous avantgarde was the Pleiades. It is all the more suitable as no one with the naked eye can make out the correct number in the group of stars that we colloquially call The Seven Sisters. There are many more of them, and in the firmament of Spanish poetry these Pleiades are usually numbered at around twenty-five – a brilliant cluster of lyric talent. Among those who came to shine the brightest and the longest is Vicente Aleixandre.\nThe affinity of the new style with French surrealism is striking. There are those in Spain who prefer to call it apparent. They are sometimes reluctant to stress the points in common, asserting their unconformity all the more strongly. The Spanish declaration of independence is not without ground. The Second Golden Age, which is another name for the breakthrough and epoch of the Pleiades, referred directly and expressly to the first, Spain’s century-long age of greatness, the baroque. When the young guard banded together to strike their big blow they chose as a standard to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Luis de Góngora, the creator of the hair-splitting “estilo culto” who originated and gave his name to the ingeniously and extravagantly ornamented gongorism. Virtuose pastiches on Spanish baroque poetry in frills, and beside them folksong variations of rustic themes, were characteristic elements in the renewal during the 1920s south of the Pyrenees, and they distinguish it undeniably from the manifestos up by the Seine.\nWhen this vital generation of poets, with Lorca at the head, stormed the Spanish Parnassus, Aleixandre too was busy with his pen. He was then writing about the need of rationalization and pension and insurance problems on the Spanish railways, where he was employed. But in 1925 something happened which was to determine the whole of his existence and still does today. He was taken seriously ill with renal tuberculosis. It changed his life in two ways. He had to leave his employment and he could take another position with communications of a different kind: those of poetry. When the Góngora anniversary was celebrated he had not yet published his first volume of verse, but he had printed poems in the Pleiades’ magazines and was already a member of the group. He was perhaps the one least concerned about the connexion with “the golden century” and to that extent also the one who came closest to the new doctrines from Paris. This may be the background to a somewhat defiant declaration by one of his poet friends that Spanish surrealism had given French surrealism what it had always lacked – a great poet: Vicente Aleixandre. But he has never been a mediator in this literary frontier dispute. Against the basic article of faith “l’ecriture automatique” he has reiterated his belief in “la conciencia creadora”, creative consciousness. He went his own way.\nIn extremely simplified terms it is the way from a cosmic vision to a realistic close-up. One of Aleixandre’s conclusive collections of poems is called\nLa destrucción o el amor\n(Destruction or Love). The title is thematically pregnant with meaning and certain Aleixandre connoisseurs have taken it to mean an Either-Or, to quote Kierkegaard: without love all that is left to us is destruction. But the word “or” can mean not only two alternative contrasts but also an explanatory addition, and what the title then says is: Destruction, in other words love. It would agree better with the perspective of creation in its entirety that these poems, and those that followed, aim at depicting and that Aleixandre has been striving for ever since his debut with Ambito. “Man is an element in the cosmos and in his being does not differ from it”, as he himself says. Love is destruction, but destruction is a result of or an act of love, of self-effacement, of man’s innate yearning to be received back into the world order from which, as a living being, he has been separated and cast out – “segregado – degradado”. His decease therefore has nothing of despair at a meaningful life meeting with a meaningless death. Only with death does life acquire its meaning and is complete; it is the last birth,\nNacimiento último\n, as one of the later collections of poems is called. Aleixandre does not hesitate to carry his vision to the paradoxical extreme: “Man does not exist.” In other words: so long as he is alive, he is actually unborn.\nBut out of the conviction that man is an element in a cosmic whole grows of necessity the awareness that our short life on earth is also a part of the same course of events. It is that knowledge which has brought Aleixandre back to “the tellurian world”, as he calls it, given his continued writings a proximity to life, an openness and directness which formerly he was not capable of or did not strive for, and has made his last two books, mentioned in the introduction to this presentation, the peak of his work hitherto. On his way there, but conscious of where he was heading, he wrote in\nHistoria del corazón\na poem called\nEntre dos oscuridades un relámpago\n, A Lightning Between Two Darknesses. In it is the earth, in it is man, and life must be affirmed so long as we have it. Intentionally or not one of the gifted dreamers of our time here quotes the words of another visionary when the meaning of the play is to be explained:\n“We are such stuff as dreams are made on,\nand our little life is rounded with a sleep.”\nOutwardly too Aleixandre went his own way. When the civil war came he was bedridden and listened to the bombs exploding. Lorca was murdered, other poet friends died in prison, and when the remainder went into exile at the end of the war, a constellation scattered to the four winds, they had to leave the invalid behind. But mentally as well Aleixandre survived the regime. He never submitted to it and went on with his writing, frail but unbroken, thereby becoming the rallying-point and source of power in Spain’s spiritual life that we today have the pleasure of honouring.\nThe Swedish Academy deeply regrets that owing to his state of health Mr Aleixandre can’t be here today. But as his representative we greet his friend and younger colleague, Mr Justo Jorge Padron, and I ask you, Mr Padron, to convey to Mr Aleixandre our warmest congratulations and to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, awarded to him, from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nFrom\n, Literature 1968-1980\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Only the dreamers, who dream   while awake, call back the shadows of the past and braid from   unspun threads, unspun nets.” These words from one of Isaac   Bashevis Singer’s stories in the collection\nThe Spinoza of   Market Street\n(1961) say quite a lot about the writer himself   and his narrative art.\nSinger was born in a small town or village in eastern Poland and   grew up in one of the poor, over-populated Jewish quarters of   Warsaw, before and during the First World War. His father was a   rabbi of the Hasid school of piety, a spiritual mentor for a   motley collection of people who sought his help. Their language   was Yiddish – the language of the simple people and of the   mothers, with its sources far back in the middle ages and with an   influx from several different cultures with which this people had   come in contact during the many centuries they had been scattered   abroad. It is Singer’s language. And it is a storehouse which has   gathered fairytales and anecdotes, wisdom, superstitions and   memories for hundreds of years past through a history that seems   to have left nothing untried in the way of adventures and   afflictions. The Hasid piety was a kind of popular Jewish   mysticism. It could merge into prudery and petty-minded, strict   adherence to the law. But it could also open out towards   orgiastic frenzy and messianic raptures or illusions.\nThis world was that of East-European Jewry – at once very rich   and very poor, peculiar and exotic but also familiar with all   human experience behind its strange garb. This world has now been   laid waste by the most violent of all the disasters that have   overtaken the Jews and other people in Poland. It has been rooted   out and reduced to dust. But it comes alive in Singer’s writings,   in his waking dreams, his very waking dreams, clear-sighted and   free of illusion but also full of broad-mindedness and   unsentimental compassion. Fantasy and experience change shape.   The evocative power of Singer’s inspiration acquires the stamp of   reality, and reality is lifted up by dreams and imagination into   the sphere of the supernatural, where nothing is impossible and   nothing is sure.\nSinger began his writing career in Warsaw in the years between   the wars. Contact with the secularized environment and the   surging social and cultural currents involved a liberation from   the setting in which he had grown up – but also a conflict. The   clash between tradition and renewal, between other-worldliness   and pious mysticism on the one hand and free thought, doubt and   nihilism on the other, is an essential theme in Singer’s short   stories and novels. Among many other themes, it is dealt with in   Singer’s big family chronicles – the novels\nThe Family   Moskat\n,\nThe Manor\nand\nThe Estate\n, from the   1950s and 1960s. These extensive epic works depict how old Jewish   families are broken up by the new age and its demands and how   they are split, socially and humanly. The author’s apparently   inexhaustible psychological fantasy and insight have created a   microcosm, or rather a well-populated micro-chaos, out of   independent and graphically convincing figures.\nSinger’s earliest fictional works, however, were not big novels   but short stories and novellas. The novel\nSatan in Goray\nappeared in 1935, when the Nazi terror was threatening and just   before the author emigrated to the USA, where he has lived and   worked ever since. It treats of a theme to which Singer has often   returned in different ways – the false Messiah, his seductive   arts and successes, the mass hysteria around him, his fall and   the breaking up of illusions in destitution and new illusions or   in penance and purity.\nSatan in Goray\ntakes place in the   17th century after the cruel ravages of the Cossacks with   outrages and mass murder of Jews and others. The book anticipates   what was to come in\nour\ntime. These people are not wholly   evil, not wholly good – they are haunted and harassed by things   over which they have no control, by the force of circumstances   and by their own passions – something alien but also very   close.\nThis is typical of Singer’s view of humanity – the power and   fickle inventiveness of obsession, the destructive but also   inflaming and creative potential – of the emotions and their   grotesque wealth of variation. The passions can be of the most   varied kinds – often sexual but also fanatical hopes and dreams,   the figments of terror, the lure of lust or power, the nightmares   of anguish. Even boredom can become a restless passion, as with   the main character in the tragicomic picaresque novel\nThe   Magician of Lublin\n(1961), a kind of Jewish Don Juan and   rogue, who ends up as an ascetic or saint. In a sense a   counterpart to this book is\nThe Slave\n(1962), really a   legend of a lifelong, faithful love which becomes a compulsion,   forced into fraud despite its purity, heavy to bear though sweet,   saintly but with the seeds of shamefulness and deceit. The saint   and the rogue are near of kin.\nSinger has perhaps given of his best as a consummate storyteller   and stylist in the short stories and in the numerous and   fantastic novellas, available in English translation in about a   dozen collections. The passions and crazes are personified in   these strange tales as demons, spectres and ghosts, all kinds of   infernal or supernatural powers from the rich storehouse of   Jewish popular belief or of his own imagination. These demons are   not only graphic literary symbols but also real, tangible forces.   The middle ages seem to spring to life again in Singer’s works,   the daily round is interwoven with wonders, reality is spun from   dreams, the blood of the past pulsates in the present. This is   where Singer’s narrative art celebrates its greatest triumphs and   bestows a reading experience of a deeply original kind, harrowing   but also stimulating and edifying. Many of his characters step   with unquestioned authority into the Pantheon of literature where   the eternal companions and mythical figures live, tragic – and   grotesque, comic and touching, weird and wonderful – people of   dream and torment, baseness and grandeur.\nDear Mr. Singer, master and magician! It is my task and my great   pleasure to convey to you the heartiest congratulations of the   Swedish Academy and to ask you to receive from the hands of His   Majesty the King the Nobel Prize for Literature 1978.\nFrom\nLes Prix Nobel\n.

He had picked them himself on Hymettus, the mountain a few miles east of Athens where Aphrodite had her miraculous spring and where, ever since antiquity, hyacinths grow wild in a profusion which makes the whole mountain smell of honey.\nThe episode comes naturally to mind now that we have the pleasure of welcoming Odysseus Elytis, the Greek writer who in his youth made his name with the collection\nThe Concert of Hyacinths\n, in which he calls to his beloved: “Take with you the light of hyacinths and baptize it in the wellspring of day” and assures her that “when you glitter in the sun that on you glides waterdrops, and deathless hyacinths, and silences, I proclaim you the only reality.”\nBut there is a more immediate reason today to think of the chivalrous gesture in the inhospitable sleet of the airport. The hyacinths Seferis gave us were not at all like those we are accustomed to see. And, freshly picked as they were, they became symbols not only of the climatic difference between the giver’s sunny south and our snowy north. If Odysseus Elytis, the author of\nThe Concert of Hyacinths\n, had wished to use that flower as one of the analogies between environment and perception that are an essential part of his cultural outlook, he could have said that our potplants are a west-European rationalization of something which in his country grows wild, thereby acquiring its everlasting beauty. To this beauty he has devoted most of what he has written, and a recurrent theme is the prevalent west-European misconception of all that goes to make up the distinctive world of ideas whose legitimate heir he is.\nHe has arrived at his critical view of our all too rationalistic picture of Greece, which he traces back to the Renaissance’s ideal of antiquity, by his own familiarity with western Europe’s poetry, art and way of thinking. It may seem like a paradox – one which he himself has pointed out-that it was this western Europe, branded by him for its sterile rationalism, which gave Elytis the impulse that all at once set free his own writing: surrealism, which cannot be said to exaggerate reason.\nThe paradox is, if not apparent, at any rate not entirely unusual. Like a rebellious pulse of exuberant life surrealism broke through the hardened arteries of calcified forms. Outside France too poetry was dominated by a school which called itself “Les Parnassiens” but which never reached even the foot of Parnassus, if we share Elytis’s view of what Greece has been and still is. But also on the Greek Parnassus of that time sat the same connoisseurs of degeneration who, in ornate words, declared their pessimistic conviction that nothing in this world was worth anything except their ability to express perfectly this very thought. If such an atmosphere is to be called captivating, surrealism came as a liberation, a religious revival, even if the sign of the saved here and there was a mere speaking with tongues.\nBut much of the best that happens when an art form is rejuvenated is not the result of a definite program but the fruit of an unforeseen cross. For Greek poetry the contact with surrealism meant a flowering which allows us to call the last fifty years Hellas’s second highwater mark. In none of the numerous important poets who have created this age of greatness can we see more clearly than in Elytis what this vigorous cross signified: the exciting meeting between epoch-making modernism and inherited myth.\nA cursory presentation of a poet hard to understand should, then, first establish his relationship to these two components – surrealism and myth. The task is not as easy as it looks. We have his own word for it: “I considered surrealism,” he says on the one hand, “as the last available oxygen in a dying world, dying, at least, in Europe.” On the other hand he states definitely: “I never was a disciple of the surrealist school.” Nor was he. Elytis will have nothing to do with its fundamental poetry, the automatic writing with its unchecked torrent of chance associations. His explorations in poetry’s means of expression lead him to surrealism’s antipodes. Even if its violent display of unproven combinations released his own writing, he is a man of strict form, the master of deliberate creation.\nRead his\nTo Axion Estí\n, by many regarded as his most representative work. With its painstaking composition and stately rhetoric it leaves not one syllable to chance. Or take his love poem Monogram, with its ingenious mathematical basis; it has few counterparts in the literature we know. It comprises seven songs, each with seven lines or multiples of seven in a rising scale 7-2 l-35 up to the middle song’s culmination of 49, where the poem turns round and descends the staircase with exactly the same number of lines, 35-21 – down to the final song’s 7, the starting point. This is nothing that need worry the poem’s readers; it has its beauty without our having to count its steps. But poetry with this structure like an Euclidean linear drawing does not take after surrealism’s\nécriture automatique\n.\nElytis’s relationship to the other component, to Greek myth, also calls for clarification. We are used to seeing Greece’s treasure of myths melted down and remoulded to contemporary west-European patterns. We have an Antigone à la Racine, an Antigone à la Anouilh and we shall have more. For Elytis such treatment is odious, a rationalistic pot-cultivation of wildflowers. He himself writes no Antigone à la Breton. He imitates no myths at all and attacks those compatriots who do. In this world of ideas he also has his share of responsibility, though his writing is a repetition not of ancient tales from the Greek past but of the way in which myths are produced.\nHe sees his Greece with its glorious traditions, its mountains whose peaks with their very names remind us how high the human spirit has attained, and its waters the Aegean Sea, Elytis’s home, whose waves for thousands of years have washed ashore the riches that the West has been able to gather in and pride itself on. For him this Greece is still a living, ever-active myth, and he depicts it just as the old mythmakers did, by personifying it and giving it human form. It lends a sensuous nearness to his visions, and the myth that is the creed of his poetry is incarnated by beautiful young people in an enchanting landscape who love life and each other in dazzling sunshine where the waves break on the shore.\nWe can call this an optimistic idealization and, despite the concreteness, a flight from the present moment and reality. Elytis’s very language, ritually solemn, is constantly striving to get away from everyday life with its pettiness. The idealization explains both the rapture and the criticism that his poetry has aroused. Elytis himself has given his view of the matter, point by point. Greek as a language, he says, opposes a pessimistic description of life, and for\nla poésie maudite\nit has no expressions. For west- Europeans all mysticism is associated with the darkness and the night, but for the Greeks light is the great mystery and every radiant day its recurrent miracle. The sun, the sea and love are the basic and purifying elements.\nThose who maintain that all true poetry must be a reflection of its age and a political act he can refer to his harrowing poem about the second lieutenant who fell in the Albanian war. Elytis, himself a second lieutenant, chanced to be one of the two officers who opened the secret order of general mobilization. He took part at the front in the passionate and hopeless fight against Mussolini’s crushing superiority, and his lament over the fallen brother-in-arms, who personifies Greece’s never-completed struggle for existence, is committed poetry in a much more literal and harsher sense than that familiar to those who usually clamour for literature’s commitment.\nElytis’s conclusions from his participation were of a different nature. The poet, he says, does not necessarily have to express his time. He can also heroically defy it. His calling is not to jot down items about our daily life with its social and political situations and private griefs. On the contrary, his only way leads “from what is to what may be”. In its essence, therefore, Elytis’s poetry is not logically clear as we see it but derives its light from the limpidity of the present moment against a perspective behind it. His myth has its roots by the Aegean Sea, which was his cradle, but the myth is about humanity, drawing its nourishment not from a vanished golden age but from one which can never be realized. It is pointless to call this either optimism or pessimism. For, if I have understood him aright, only our future is worth bearing in mind and the unattainable alone is worth striving for.\nCher Maitre,\nMalheureusement, mais sans doute au soulagement de l’auditoire, je ne parle pas votre langue. Pour employer la locution anglaise spécifique à quelque chose d’etrange: “It’s Greek to me”. Mais votre poésie n’est certainement pas étrangère, portée par la mer, qui est en même temps la mere de la civilisation européenne. Dans cette descendance nous mettons notre gloire, et, par consequent, il faut que je contredise votre diagnostic de notre état deplorable. Ce dont nous sommes atteints, ce n’est pas du tout d’un excès de rationalisme. Au contraire, la maladie de l’Europe occidentale c’est justement que le rationalisme est rationné. Et le peu que nous en détenons encore, ce ne sont pas les devoirs que nous ont donnés à apprendre nos philosophes de la renaissance. La sagesse claire et la logique pure de Platon et d’Aristote, peut-être aussi de Protagoras, de Gorgias et de Socrate lui-même, voilà les racines du rationalisme, dont nous ne voyons aujourd’hui que les épaves pitoyables.\nNéanmoins Socrate, quand la raison ne lui donnait pas de gouverne, a écouté la voix de son daimon, et, cher maître, c’est avec une admiration très profonde que nous avons écouté se faire entendre en votre poésie la même voix de mystère, le daimonde votre pays.\nJ’ai grand plaisir à vous transmettre les felicitations les plus cordiales de l’Académie suédoise et à vous demander de recevoir des mains de Sa Majesté le Roi le Prix Nobel de litérature de cette année.\nFrom\n, Literature 1968-1980\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Industrialization had not made itself felt in earnest. People lived in close contact with a still unspoilt nature. This culture and most of its people no longer exist. The Nazi terror and genocide, war and oppression have wreaked devastation.\nMilosz took an early interest in literature and became one of the leading writers in the young generation who wanted to renew poetry and who took an active part in underground freedom movements against the Nazi tyranny. As a socialist he was attached to the new Poland’s intellectual elite, becoming in time a trusted cultural person who represented his country abroad. However, the political climate changed during the cold war in a Stalinistic direction. With his uncompromising demand for artistic integrity and human freedom Milosz could no longer support the regime. In 1951 he left Poland and settled in Paris as a “free writer” – a term not without ironic overtones. In 1960 he moved to USA as a lecturer on Polish literature at Berkeley University. His roots in Poland and his connections with its intellectual life have, however, never been broken.\nDisruption and breaking up have marked Milosz’s life from the very beginning. In both an outward and an inward sense he is an exiled writer – a stranger for whom the physical exile is really a reflection of a metaphysical or even religious exile applying to humanity in general. The world that Milosz depicts in his poetry and prose, works and essays is the world in which man lives after having been driven out of paradise. But the paradise from which he has been banished is not any bleating idyll but a genuine Old Testament Eden for better or worse, with the Serpent as a rival for supremacy. The destructive and treacherous forces are mingled with the good and creative ones – both are equally true and present.\nThe tensions and contrasts are typical of Milosz’s art and outlook on life. According to him one of the writer’s most important tasks is “ouvrir à celui qui le lit une dimension qui rend l’affaire de vivre plus passionnante” – “from galactic silence protect us” and show us “how difficult it is to remain just one person.” There is much of the Preacher’s or Pascal’s fervour in him – a passionate striving to make us intensely aware that we are living scattered abroad and that there\nis\nno paradise but that evil and havoc are forces to combat. To look reality in the face is not to see everything in darkness and give up in gloom and despair, nor is it to see everything in light and to lapse into escapism and delusion. Still less is it to blur the contours and the focus in favour of convenience or compromise. The tensions, the passion, the contrasts – the diaspora at once freely acknowledged and enforced – are the true meaning of our human condition.\nMilosz is a very intellectual writer, trained in philosophy and literature. His writing is full of voices and references, pastiches and ironies, breaches of style and roles. It is polyphonic in its structure.\nBut he is also a very sensual writer. One cannot hope to find the rhythmical qualities and the linguistic sensuousness justly reproduced in translation. But the inherent sensuality is there in full measure. His imagery has the character of surprise that only experience can give – that which is experienced in the empirical world, the imagination or memory. The intellectual trait in Milosz has a direct counterpart in this talent for lucidity and this requited love of the sensuous. In proximity to concrete reality and in human traditions and fellowship he seeks a defence against the destructive forces that hold sway in the world to which we are delivered against our will. Distance and presence characterize him in like degree. The same applies to his relationship to his new country, where he is a writer who must be translated to be understood and who is understood and valued, though perhaps in a roundabout way and in incomplete reproductions. He holds that in fact this is something that concerns us all, writers or not.\nStrong passions but also strict discipline and unerring perspicacity mark Milosz’s work. An implacable fervour never lets him reconcile himself to man’s powerlessness, to the tendency of language towards tricks of illusion and the failures of sympathy, to “remorse that we did not love the poor ashes in Sachsenhausen with absolute love, beyond human power.” This fervour of his combines with a mature and sorely tried man’s broadmindedness and with a striving for self-control and a stoic or even Epicurean heroism. One comes across outbursts of defiance and rage – almost Nietzschean in their frenzy against the conditions of creation which compel man to be nothing but a man, unable – as the gods can – to change what is mean and cruel. Against this are contrasted moments of calmly clarified repose in what is merely simple and present – miraculously present. His writing is many-voiced and dramatic, insistent and provocative, changing between different moods and levels, from the elegiac to the furious and from the abstract to the extremely concrete.\nCzeslaw Milosz is a difficult writer, in the best sense of the word-challenging and demanding, captivating not least because of his complications.\nDear Mr. Milosz! You have sometimes spoken of your language, Polish, as a small language of a rather small people, unknown to most of the world. I have tried to comment upon your life, views and experiences, documented in Polish and nourished on Polish traditions and culture. I have spoken in a still smaller language, still less known to the rest of the world and rather alien from Polish traditions. And I have had a very short time at my disposal to try to describe some of the experiences when reading you. Now I will conclude in English – a language which is neither yours nor mine – and in a still shorter time. Of course I am not able to do justice to you – not at all.\nThere is a certain irony in the situation – an irony not out of place in this connection. You have often pictured human conditions as basically alienated – we are foreigners in this world and foreigners to one another. But not only foreigners. The Nobel Prize to you is also a token and a proof of the fact that borders may be crossed, understanding and sympathy fostered, and animating, living contacts or correspondences created. To read your writings and be confronted with their challenges, means to become enriched with important, new experiences – in spite of all alienation.\nIt is my great pleasure to express the heartfelt congratulations of the Swedish Academy and to ask you to receive this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nFrom\n, Literature 1968-1980\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

He has never abandoned it, and he has often avowed his love of the highest manifestations of the classical German culture.\nIn a speech in Vienna in 1936 Canetti praised Hermann Broch as one of the few contemporary representative writers. What irremissible demands, according to Canetti, must be made upon the truly representative man? He must be subject to his time as its “lowest slave” and yet be in opposition to it; in a wish for universality he must summarize his age, and he must possess the most distinct “conception of atmospheric impressions”. Such criteria also mark Canetti’s own writings. Pursued in different directions and comprising several genres, they are held together by a most original and vigorously profiled personality.\nHis foremost purely fictional achievement is the great novel Die Blendung (“Auto da Fé”), published in 1935 but attaining its full effect only during the last decades: against the background of National Socialism’s brutal power politics, the novel acquires a deepened perspective.\nDie Blendung\nwas part of an originally planned series of novels which was to take the shape of a “\ncomédie humaine\nof madmen”. The book has such fantastic and demoniacal elements that associations with Russian 19th-Century writers like Gogol and Dostoevsky are apparent. It is an aspect of key importance when\nDie Blendung\nis regarded by several critics as a single fundamental metaphor for the threat exercised by the “mass man” within ourselves. Close at hand is the viewpoint from which the novel stands out as a study of a type of man who isolates himself in self-sufficient specialization, only to succumb helplessly in a world of ruthlessly harsh realities.\nDie Blendung\nleads over to the big examination of the origin, composition and reaction patterns of the mass movements which Canetti, after decades of research and study, published with\nMasse und Macht\n(“Crowds and Power”) in 1960. It is a magisterial work by a polyhistor who can disclose an overwhelmingly large number of viewpoints of men’s behaviour as mass beings. In his basically a historical analysis what he wants to expose and attack by scrutinizing the origin and nature of the masses is, in the end, the religion of power. Survival becomes the nucleus of power. At last the mortal enemy is death itself: this is a principal theme, held to with a strangely pathetic strength, in Canetti’s literary works.\nApart from the intensive work on\nMasse und Macht\nCanetti has written aphoristic notes, issued in several volumes. Abundant humour and a satirical bite in the observation of people’s behaviour, a loathing of wars and devastation, bitterness at the thought of life’s brevity are characteristic features here.\nCanetti’s three plays are all of a more or less absurd kind. In their portrayal of extreme situations, often depicting human vulgarity, these “acoustic masks”, as he himself calls them, give an interesting glimpse into his unique world of ideas.\nAmong his many sharp-sighted portrait studies special mention can be made of\nDer andere Prozess\n(“Kafka’s Other Trial”), in which with intense involvement he examines Kafka’s complicated relationship to Felice Bauer. The study resolves into a picture of a man whose life and work meant the relinquishing of power.\nFinally, standing out as a peak in Canetti’s writings, are his memoirs, so far in two large volumes. In these recollections of his childhood and youth he reveals his forceful epic power of description to its full extent. A great deal of the political and cultural life in central Europe in the early 1900’s – especially the form it took in Vienna – is reflected in the memoirs. The peculiar environments, the many remarkable human destinies with which Canetti has been confronted and his unique educational path – always aiming at universal knowledge – are seen here in a style and with a lucidity that have very few qualitative equivalents in the memoirs written in the German language during this century.\nDear Mr Canetti, with your versatile writings, which attack sick tendencies in our age, you wish to serve the cause of humanity. Intellectual passion is combined in you with the moral responsibility that – in your own words – “is nourished by mercy”.

The book has been translated into a large number of languages and has sold millions of copies. It is still being reprinted and read with undiminished interest by new readers. Such a success with a single work could be fatal for a writer with less resources than those possessed by García Márquez. He has, however, gradually confirmed his position as a rare storyteller richly endowed with a material, from imagination and experience, which seems inexhaustible. In breadth and epic richness, for instance, the novel\nEl otoño del patriarca\n, 1975, (The Autumn of the Patriarch) compares favourably with the first-mentioned work. Short novels such as\nEl coronel no tiene quien le escriba\n, 1961 (No One Writes to the Colonel),\nLa mala hora\n, 1962 (An Evil Hour), or last year’s\nCrónica de una muerte anunciada\n(Chronicle of a Death Foretold), complement the picture of a writer who combines the copious, almost overwhelming narrative talent with the mastery of the conscious, disciplined and widely read artist of language. A large number of short stories, published in several collections or in magazines, give further proof of the great versatility of García Márquez’ narrative gift. His international successes have continued. Each new work of his is received by expectant critics and readers as an event of world importance, is translated into many languages and published as quickly as possible in large editions.\nNor can it be said that any literary unknown continent or province is brought to light with the prize to Gabriel García Márquez. For a long time Latin American literature has shown a vigour as in few other literary spheres. It has won acclaim in the cultural life of today. Many impulses and traditions cross each other. Folk culture, including oral storytelling, reminiscences from old Indian culture, currents from Spanish baroque in different epochs, influences from European surrealism and other modernism are blended into a spiced and life-giving brew. From it García Márquez and other Spanish-American writers derive material and inspiration. The violent conflicts of political nature – social and economic – raise the temperature of the intellectual climate. Like most of the other important writers in the Latin American world, García Márquez is strongly committed politically on the side of the poor and the weak against oppression and economic exploitation. Apart from his fictional production he has been very active as a journalist, his writings being many-sided, inventive, often provocative and by no means limited to political subjects.\nThe great novels remind one of\nWilliam Faulkner\n. García Márquez has created a world of his own round the imaginary town of Macondo. In his novels and short stories we are led into this peculiar place where the miraculous and the real converge. The extravagant flight of his own fantasy combines with traditional folk tales and facts, literary allusions and tangible – at times obtrusively graphic – descriptions approaching the matter-of-factness of reportage. As with Faulkner, the same chief characters and minor persons crop up in different stories. They are brought forward into the light in various ways – sometimes in dramatically revealing situations, sometimes in comic and grotesque complications of a kind that only the wildest imagination or shameless reality itself can achieve. Manias and passions harass them. Absurdities of war let courage change shape with craziness, infamy with chivalry, cunning with madness.\nDeath is perhaps the most important director behind the scenes in García Márquez’ invented and discovered world. Often his stories revolve around a dead person – someone who has died, is dying or will die. A tragic sense of life characterizes García Márquez’ books – a sense of the incorruptible superiority of fate and the inhuman, inexorable ravages of history. But this awareness of death and tragic sense of life is broken by the narrative’s unlimited, ingenious vitality, which in its turn is a representative of the at once frightening and edifying vital force of reality and life itself. The comedy and grotesqueness in García Márquez can be cruel, but can also glide over into a conciliating humour.\nWith his stories García Márquez has created a world of his own which is a microcosmos. In its tumultuous, bewildering yet graphically convincing authenticity it reflects a continent and its human riches and poverty.\nPerhaps more than that: a cosmos in which the human heart and the combined forces of history time and again burst the bounds of chaos-killing and procreation.\nMonsieur García Márquez,\nNe disposant que de quelques minutes, je n’ai pu donner de votre œuvre littéraire qu’une image d’aspect general et assez abstraite.

It has reached readers who can be numbered in tens of millions. In other words, the book was a bestseller, in a way that is usually granted only to adventure stories, light reading and children’s books. The same goes for several of his later novels.\nThe reason is simple. These books are very entertaining and exciting. They can be read with pleasure and profit without the need to make much effort with learning or acumen. But they have also aroused an unusually great interest in scholars, writers and other interpreters, who have sought and found deep strata of ambiguity and complication in Golding’s work. In those who use the tools of narration and linguistic art they have incited to thinking, discovery and creation of their own, in order to explore the world we live in and to settle down in it. In this respect William Golding can perhaps be compared to the American Herman Melville, whose works are full of equivocal profundity as well as fascinating adventure. In fact the resemblance extends farther than that. Golding has a very keen sight and sharp pen when it comes to the power of evil and baseness in human beings. He often chooses his themes and the framework for his stories from the world of the sea or from other challenging situations in which odd people are tempted to reach beyond their limits, thereby being bared to the very marrow. His stories usually have a fairly schematic drama, almost an anecdote, as skeleton. He then covers this with a richly varied and spicy flesh of colourful characters and surprising events.\nIt is the pattern of myth that we find in his manner of writing.\nA very few basic experiences and basic conflicts of a deeply general nature underlie all his work as motive power. In one of his essays he describes how as a young man he took an optimistic view of existence. He believed that man would be able to perfect himself by improving society and eventually doing away with all social evil. His optimism was akin to that of other utopians, for instance H.G. Wells. The Second World War changed his outlook. He discovered what one human being is really able to do to another. And it was not a question of headhunters in New Guinea or primitive tribes in the Amazon region – he writes. They were atrocities committed with cold professional skill by well-educated and cultured people – doctors, lawyers and those with a long tradition of high civilization behind them. They carried out their crimes against their own equals. He writes:\n“I must say that anyone who moved through those years without understanding that man produces evil as a bee produces honey, must have been blind or wrong in the head.”\nGolding inveighs against those who think that it is the political or other systems that create evil. Evil springs from the depths of man himself – it is the wickedness in human beings that creates the evil systems or that changes what from the beginning is, or could be, good into something iniquitous and destructive.\nThere is a mighty religious dimension in William Golding’s conception of the world, though hardly Christian in the ordinary sense. He seems to believe in a kind of Fall. Perhaps rather one should say that he works with the myth of a Fall. In some of his stories, chiefly the novel\nThe Inheritors\n, 1955, we find a dream of an original state of innocence in the history of mankind. The Fall came with the motive power of a new species. The aggressive intelligence, the power-hungry self-assertion and the overweening individualism are the source of evil and violence – individual as well as social violence. But these qualities and incentives are also innate in man as a created being. They are therefore inseparably a part of his character and make themselves felt when he gives full expression to himself and forms his societies and his private destiny.\nWe come across this tragic drama in many different ways in William Golding’s novels. In\nLord of the Flies\na group of young boys are isolated on a desert island. Soon a kind of primitive society takes shape and is split into warring factions, one marked by decency and willingness to co-operate, the other by worship of force, lust for power and violence. The novel\nPincher Martin\n, 1956, depicts how the main character, the narrator, is drowning. In his passionate absorption in himself he seems for a time to get the better of death. He does so by recounting his life, a life full of ruthless egoism and cruelty to others, a miserable life yet it was his and on no account does he want to lose it. He, the dead man, tries to make the rock to which he is clinging into a picture of himself. It is a weird ghost story, a fable of a will to live without shame or moderation.\nIn the novel\nRites of Passage\n, 1980, the drama is enacted in the microcosm that the author arranges on a ship of the line at the beginning of the 19th Century. The book gives a cruel and drastic description of social barriers and aggressions on this ship, with an underlying black comedy and a masterly command of the characters’ various linguistic roles. The scapegoat – one of many in Golding’s works – is a priest who, naively trusting in the authority of his office, tries to assert his own dignity. He is subjected to outrages, each worse than the last, himself taking part in them, and ends up in such a desperate situation that he dies of shame.\nAll is not evil in the world of mankind, however, and all is not black in William Golding’s imagined world. According to him, man has two characteristics – the ability to murder is one, belief in God the other. Innocence is not entirely lost. There is a striving away from evil. This striving often goes astray in self-assertion and illusionism. But it is there nevertheless and is allied with something that is not merely human. In the novel\nThe Spire\n, 1964, this striving is imbodied in a story about the building of a medieval cathedral. The builder is a priest who believes he has been ordered by God to build a spire that defies all reasonable calculations and measurements. His striving is both good and bad, containing the most complex reasons-humility and conviction but also arrogance, wilfulness and furtive sexual motives.\nWilliam Golding’s novels and stories are not only sombre moralities and dark myths about evil and about treacherous, destructive forces. As already mentioned they are also colourful tales of adventure which can be read as such, full of narrative joy, inventiveness and excitement. In addition there are plentiful streaks of humour, biting irony, comedy and drastic jesting. There is a vitality which breaks through what is tragic and misanthropic, frightening in fact. A vitality, a vigour, which is infectious owing to its strength and intractability and to the paradoxical freedom it possesses as against what is related. His fabled world is tragic and pathetic, yet not overwhelming and depressing. There is a life which is mightier than life’s conditions.\nDear Mr Golding,\nIn interviews and essays you have sometimes made fun of commentators who have tried to summarize what you have written in a formula and fit your outlook on life into some pattern or other. That is impossible – simply because if it were possible there would be no reason for you to write your books and – as I hope – to continue to write. So I have not tried anything like that. I have only given a few reflexions, a few reactions to some of your novels – in the hope of conveying to those who might not yet be familiar with your works a glimpse of the fascination and stimulation which they afford. My second task is to express the warm congratulations of the Swedish Academy and to ask you to receive from the hands of His Majesty the King this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature.\nFrom\n, Literature 1981-1990\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

With almost thirty volumes of collected poems behind him he stands out today as the leading poet of his own country. He is read and loved by his countrymen, a national poet who knows how to address both those who have a literary education and those who approach his work without much schooling in their baggage.\nJaroslav Seifert was born in a working-class district on the outskirts of Prague. He has never lost touch with his popular roots or with the impoverished and socially weak people among whom he grew up. As a young man he believed in the socialistic revolution and wrote poems about it and the promise it held out for the future that enthused many of the other young people of his own generation. His poems were clear, apparently simple and artless, with elements of folk song, familiar speech and scenes from everyday life. He rejected the elevated style and formalism of an earlier period. His diction was characterized by lightness of touch, sensuality, melody and rhythm, a lively ingenuity and playfulness alternating with feeling, even pathos. These features of his art have remained constant ever since. He is not, however, a naive artist. He is a poet with an unusually broad stylistic register. At an early stage he came into contact with contemporary European modernism, especially with French surrealism and dadaism. He is also a sovereign master of traditional forms of poetry with complicated rhythms, and rhyme-schemes. He is as much at home with the drastic force of the broadside ballad as with the sophisticated artistry of the sonnet.\nThe versatility and flexibility of Seifert’s continually inventive and surprising style is matched by an equally rich human register on the level of feeling, insight and imagination. His empathy and his sense of solidarity have focused, not upon a system or a narrow programme but upon human beings – living, loving, feeling, working, creating, fabulating, suffering, laughing, longing – in short all those who live, happy or unhappy, a life that is an adventure and an experience, but not one of oppression in accordance to a party programme. Human beings are the ones who create society. The State is there for the people and not vice versa. There is an element of anarchy in Seifert’s philosophy of life – a protest against everything that cuts down life’s possibilities and reduces human beings to cogs in some machine. Perhaps this sounds innocuous. But Seifert has never been innocuous. Even his juvenile poetry meant a liberation and an adherence to a future that would abolish war, oppression and want, and would provide joy in life and beauty for those who had hitherto had little thereof. Poetry and art would help to achieve this. His demands and hopes had the confidence and magnificence of youth. During the 1920’s these hopes seemed to be on the verge of fulfilment – and avant-garde literature and art accorded with these hopes. But during the 1930’s and 1940’s the horizon darkened. Economic and political reality proved unable to live up to the rosy dreams. Seifert’s poetry acquired new characteristics – a calmer tone, a remembrance of the history and culture of his own country, a defence of national identity and of those who had preserved it, especially the great authors and artists of the past. Even purely personal experiences and memories were touched with melancholy – the transience of life, the inconstancy of emotion, the impermanence of the childhood and youth which had passed, and of the ties of love. Yet all was not melancholia and nostalgia in Seifert’s work – far from it. The concreteness and freshness of his perceptions and his images continued to flourish. He wrote some of his most beautiful love lyrics, his popularity increased and it was at this time that the foundations of his position as a national poet were firmly laid. He was loved as dearly for the astonishing clarity, musicality and sensuality of his poems as for his unembellished but deeply felt identification with his country and its people. He had dissociated himself from the communism of his youth and from the anti-intellectual dogmatism it had developed into. Towards the end of the 1930’s and during the 1940’s Czechoslovakia fell under the yoke of the Nazis and Jaroslav Seifert committed himself to the defence of his country, its freedom and its past. He eulogized the Prague rebellion of 1945 and the liberation of his country.\nThe immediate post-war period, however, proved to be one of great disappointment to Seifert and his fellow patriots who had hoped for a bright future. Poets were expected to engage in political propaganda. Poetry of the kind that Jaroslav Seifert wrote was considered to be disloyal, bourgeois and escapist. But he refused to conform to the slogans of social realism. He hibernated – to return in earnest in connection with the thaw of 1956, and, following a long period of illness, has continued to work diligently, first and foremost as a poet, but at times also in political manifestations. He has signed Charta 77. As has already been observed, he is greatly loved and respected in his own country – and has begun to achieve international recognition as well, in spite of the disadvantage of writing in a language that is relatively little known outside his country. His work is translated and he is regarded as a poet of current interest in spite of his age.\nToday, many people think of Jaroslav Seifert as the very incarnation of the Czechoslovakian poet. He represents freedom, zest and creativity and is looked upon as this generation’s bearer of the rich culture and traditions of this country. His method is to depict and praise those things in life and the other world that are not governed by dogmas and dictates, political or otherwise. Through words he paints a world other than the one various authorities and their henchmen threaten to squeeze dry and leave destitute. He praises a Prague that is blossoming and a spring that lives in the memory, in the hopes or the defiant spirit of people who refuse to conform. He praises love, and is indeed one of the truly great love-poets of our time. Tenderness, sadness, sensuality, humour, desire and all the feelings which love between people engenders and encompasses are the themes of these poems. He praises woman – the young maiden, the student, the anonymous, the old, his mother, his beloved. Woman, for him, is virtually a mythical figure, a goddess who represents all that opposes men’s arrogance and hunger for power. Even so, she never becomes an abstract symbol but is alive and present in the poet’s fresh and unconventional verbal art. He conjures up for us another world than that of tyranny and desolation – a world that exists both here and now, although it may be hidden from our view and bound in chains, and one that exists in our dreams and our will and our art and our indomitable spirit. His poetry is a kind of maieutics – an act of deliverance.\nThe Swedish Academy deeply regrets that Mr. Jaroslav Seifert cannot be here today. As his representative we greet his daughter, Mrs. Jana Seifertová. And now I ask you, Mrs. Seifertová, to convey to Mr. Seifert our warmest congratulations and to receive this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature, awarded to your father, from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nFrom\n, Literature 1981-1990\n, Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The new writers were against the more conventional fiction and broke its rules that a novel should have a realistic story and move along in a lucid and coherent way in time. Their prose works had the appearance of linguistic montages or collages. They took place in the dimensions of memory and the apparently arbitrary or free association. Fragments from different times were closely joined on the basis of their content or emotional correspondences, but not on the basis of how they might have followed each other in the ordinary course of time. Influences from the visual arts were strongly in evidence. In a picture everything is contemporaneous. The flow of things that follow each other is brought about by the beholder’s co-creative feeling moving over what actually exists as a single coherent now.\nClaude Simon had begun with several partly autobiographical novels from the middle of the 1940s. The narrative method was almost traditional, but influenced by\nFaulkner\n. The change in Simon’s author-character came with the novels\nLe Vent\n, 1957, and\nL’Herbe\n, 1958. He himself counts the latter as the turning point in his writing. Both stories take place in the South of France, where Simon himself has his roots and lives as a viticulturist. The principal character in\nLe Vent\nis a mysteriously complex man, at once confused and discerning, exposed to the inquisitive provocations of his fellow men. He returns to the small town in the South of France to take over a bequest, a farm – and is caught up in conflicts of various kinds. And over it all howls the keen mistral, the wind that fills the people with its everlasting, parching, dusty indefatigability – an inhuman element in which the people live as if, despite their activities and meddling, they are imprisoned in conditions which are more lasting and more powerful than themselves. In both these novels the author weaves a close and evocative web of words, of events and environments, with glidings and joins of elements according to a logic different from what the realistic continuity in time and space prescribes. Here we perceive how Claude Simon’s linguistic art takes shape, such as we shall recognize his prose in later works. The language begins to live its own life. Each word and description leads on to the next. The text grows as if the language were an independently living organism which buds, puts out tendrils and sows seeds of its own accord and as if the author were a tool or a medium for its own creative force.\nSo too has Claude Simon himself described his way of working especially after his experiences when writing the book\nHistoire\n, 1967 – nothing short of a rapturous awareness of the sensual life and charm in giving oneself up to linguistic work and its surprises and seductions. The book is one of the peaks in Simon’s writing, perhaps the work in which his linguistic peculiarity is most clearly evident.\nIt was preceded by two other novels, in which we can find some of the basic themes that constantly recur in Claude Simon’s novels\nLa Route des Flandres\n, 1960, and\nLe Palace\n, 1962. The first of these two novels made Simon’s name international. It is a broad and complex description with strongly autobiographical touches and with memories and traditions from Simon’s family. The profusely flowing narration, its fragmentations and piling up of parallel actions and its discontinuous joining of scenes and of stories within stories burst the framework for narrative art in the traditional sense. The novel takes the shape of a penetrating description of the French collapse in 1940, when Simon himself took part as a cavalryman. Simon’s experiences during this war, like during the Spanish Civil War in 1936, have been of immense importance to him, constantly recurring in his writings. Cruelty and absurdity are the dominating things – unforeseeable. What is apparently well-planned ends in confusion and dissolution. Each one lives through his hardships and has to save himself as best he can. Simon’s experiences from the Spanish Civil War were similar, depicted in\nLe Palace\nand his latest and most important novel,\nLes Géorgiques\n, 1981. For all the sympathies which he and others might have for those faithful to the government who fought against the fascists, it soon turned out that these government champions for their part could not follow any regular and intelligently planned strategies and operations. On the contrary, the fighters were split into factions and mutual strife, obstructions and hazardous enterprises. Simon’s picture of the Spanish Civil War and of the intellectual idealists who wanted to find an ideologically clear reason in the fight against oppression, shapes itself into a version, at once grotesque and tragic, compassionate and ironic, of war’s reality and of man’s inability to guide his fate and correct his conditions.\nLa Route des Flandres\nand\nLes Géorgiques\nare richly decorated compositions which, with sensuous perspicacity and linguistic invocation, conjure up an extremely complicated pattern of personal memories and family traditions, of experiences during modern war and of equivalents from bygone ages, to be exact the Napoleonic era. The parallels are the same. The violence and the absurdity are common to all, likewise the painful compassion and feeling that the author expresses in paradoxical contrast to the fascination that these phenomena obviously have for him. A similar feeling is characteristic of Simon’s descriptions of erotic relationships. In these contexts too there is a fixation with violence and violation. The sexual contacts appear as conquests, the taking in possession, mountings which resemble what stallions and mares do, or outrages resembling what occurs in battle. A tragic feeling of life emerges also here – a picture of human loneliness and of how people are exposed to destructive passions and selfish impulses, disguised as vain striving for fellowship and intimacy.\nAgainst these descriptions are contrasting elements of another kind – of tenderness and loyalty, or devotion to work and duty, to heritage and traditions and solidarity with dead and living kinsmen. In particular there appears as a contrast of a consoling or edifying kind the devotion to such as grows and sprouts independent of man’s lust for power and overweening enterprise. There is a growth which lives by its own power, despite what men can do. The best people in Simon’s novels are those who subordinate themselves to this growth and serve it. We meet some old women, loyal to farm and family and traditions. We even meet in the brutal and at last disillusioned warrior a loyal love for his dead young wife. We meet a serving and a patient endurance which, without any self-important airs, is reflected within these people, which lives with them even if otherwise in their ostentatious deeds and ways they seem filled with egoism and brutality.\nFirst and foremost we meet this growth, this vitality and this creativeness and this viability in language and memory, in the shaping, the renewal and the development of what is and was and what rises again inspired and alive through the pictures in words and story for which we seem to be more instruments than masters. Claude Simon’s narrative art may appear as a representation of something that lives within us whether we will or not, whether we understand it or not, whether we believe it or not – something hopeful, in spite of all cruelty and absurdity which for that matter seem to characterize our condition and which is so perceptively, penetratingly and abundantly reproduced in his novels.\nMonsieur Claude Simon,\nPour caractériser vos romans, on devrait pouvoir faire œuvre à la fois de peintre et de poète.

His many-sided and vital   literary works also include some important collections of poems   and novels, an interesting autobiography and a large number of   articles and essays. He has been, and is, very active as a man of   the theatre and has staged his own plays in England and Nigeria.   He has himself taken part as an actor and energetically joined in   theatrical debates and theatre policies. During the civil war in   Nigeria in the middle of the 1960s he was drawn into the struggle   for liberty because of his opposition to violence and terror. He   was imprisoned under brutal and illegal forms in 1967 and was   released over two years later – an experience that drastically   affected his outlook on life and literary work.\nSoyinka has depicted his childhood in a   little African village. His father was a teacher, his mother a   social worker – both Christian. But in the preceding generation   there were medicine men and others who believed firmly in   spirits, magic, and rites of anything but a Christian kind. We   encounter a world in which tree sprites, ghosts, sorcerer and   primitive African traditions were living realities. We also come   face to face with a more complicated world of myth, which has its   roots far back in an African culture handed down by word of   mouth. This account of childhood gives a background to Soyinka’s   literary works – a self-experienced, close connection with a rich   and complex African heritage.\nSoyinka made an early appearance as a   dramatist. It was natural for him to seek this art form, which is   closely linked with the African material and with African forms   of linguistic and mime creation. His plays make frequent and   skilful use of many elements belonging to stage art and which   also have genuine roots in African culture-dance and rites,   masques and pantomime, rhythm and music, declamation, theatre   within the theatre etc. His first dramas are lighter and more   playful than the later ones – pranks, ironical and satirical   scenes, pictures of everyday life with telling and witty   dialogue, often with a tragicomical or grotesque sense of life as   keynote. Among these early plays can be mentioned\nA Dance of   the Forests\n– a kind of African “Midsummer Night’s Dream”,   with dryads, ghosts, spirits, and gods or demi-gods. It is about   creativeness and sacrifice, with the god or hero Ogun as one of   the performers. This Ogun is a Prometheus – like figure – the   demigod of iron and artistic skill but also of war and battle, a   double figure combining both creation and destruction in his   being. Soyinka has often reverted to him.\nSoyinka’s dramas are deeply rooted in an   African world and culture. But he is also a widely read, not to   say learned writer and dramatist. He is familiar with western   literature, from the Greek tragedies to\nBeckett\nand Brecht.   Also outside the field of drama he is well versed in the great   European literature. A writer like James Joyce, for instance, has   left traces in his novels. Soyinka is an author who writes with   great deliberation, and especially in his novels and poems he can   be avant-gardistically sophisticated.\nDuring the war years, his time in prison   and afterwards, his writing takes on a more tragic character. The   psychological, moral and social conflicts appear more and more   complex and menacing. The book-keeping of good and evil, of   destructive and constructive forces, becomes increasingly   ambiguous. His dramas become equivocal – dramas which in the   shape of allegory or satire take up moral, social, and political   matters for mythical-dramatic creation. The dialogue is   sharpened, the characters become more expressive, often   exaggerated to the point of caricature, demanding denouement –   the dramatic temperature is raised. The vitality is no less than   in the first works – on the contrary: the satire, the humour, the   elements of grotesquery and comedy, and the mythical fable-making   come vividly to life. The way in which Soyinka makes use of the   mythical material, the African, and the literary schooling, the   European, is very independent. He says he uses the myths as “the   aesthetic matrix” for his writing. It is thus not a question of a   folkloristic reproduction, a kind of exoticism, but an   independent and co-operative work. The myths, traditions, and   rites are integrated as nourishment for his writing, not a   masquerade costume. He has called his wide reading and literary   awareness a “selective eclecticism” – i.e. purposeful and   sovereign choice. Among the later dramas special mention can be   made of\nDeath and the King’s Horseman\n– a genuinely,   dramatically convincing work full of many ideas and meanings, of   poetry, satire, surprise, cruelty, and lust. Superficially it is   about a conflict between western morals and convention on the one   hand, and African culture and tradition on the other. The theme   moves around a ritual or cultic human sacrifice. The drama goes   so deeply into human and superhuman conditions that it cannot be   reduced to something that teaches us about breaches between   different civilizations. Soyinka himself prefers to see it as a   metaphysical and religious drama of fate. It is about the   conditions of the human identity and realization, the mythical   pact of life and death, and the possibilities of the unborn.\nTo Soyinka’s non-dramatic works belong the   autobiographically inspired accounts\nThe Man Died\n, from   his time in prison, and the novel\nThe Interpreters\n, from   intellectual circles in Nigeria. The novel\nSeason of Anomy\nis an allegory with the Orpheus and Eurydice myth as framework, a   somewhat complicated, symbolic-expressionistic story with a   background in brutal social and political conditions of   oppression and corruption. Outstanding among the poems are   collections with motifs from his time in prison, some of them   written during his imprisonment as a kind of mental exercise to   help the author survive with dignity and fortitude. The imagery   in these poems is compact and rather hard to penetrate,   sometimes, however, with a laconic or ascetic concentration. It   takes some time to get to know them intimately, but they can then   yield a strange emanation that gives evidence of their background   and role in a harsh, difficult period in the poet’s life – moving   testimony to courage and artistic strength.\nAs already mentioned, it is chiefly the   dramas that stand out as Wole Soyinka’s most significant   achievement. They are of course made to be acted on the stage,   with dance, music, masques, and mime as essential components. But   his plays can also be read as important and fascinating literary   works from a richly endowed writer’s experience and imagination –   and with roots in a composite culture with a wealth of living and   artistically inspiring traditions.\nDear Mr. Soyinka, In your versatile   writings you have been able to synthesize a very rich heritage   from your own country, ancient myths and old traditions, with   literary legacies and traditions of European culture. There is a   third component, a most important component in what you have thus   achieved – your own genuine and impressive creativity as an   artist, a master of language, and your commitment as a dramatist   and writer of poetry and prose to problems of general and deep   significance for man, modern or ancient.

He sees connections, words them pithily, sees new connections. Not seldom they are contradictory and ambiguous, often caught in a flash like this: “Memory, I think, is a substitute for the tail we lost for good in the happy process of evolution. It directs our movements …”.\nIn the remarkable writings to which the Swedish Academy has drawn attention this year, poetry as the highest manifestation of life is a theme throughout. It is developed with a poetic brilliance combined with both intellectual beauty and linguistic mastery.\nBrodsky is nowadays an American citizen but he was born and grew up in Leningrad, or Peter as he calls the city after its old name of Petersburg. It is a setting in which Pushkin, Gogol and Dostoyevsky worked, and it is a setting whose architecture and ornaments – even in the war-damaged state of the 1940s and 1950s – relate an essential part of the history of our world.\nThe poet belongs to the classical Russian tradition with names such as Osip Mandelstam, Anna Akhmatova and the Nobel prizewinner\nBoris Pasternak\n. At the same time he is a virtuoso renewer of the poetical means of expression. Inspiration comes also from the West, especially the English-language poetry from the metaphysician John Donne to Robert Frost and Wystan Auden.\nLatterly Brodsky has begun also to write in English. For him Russian and English are two attitudes to the world. Having both languages at one’s disposal is like sitting on the top of an existential hill with a view over two slopes, over humanity’s two tendencies of development, he has declared. The east-west background has given him an unusual thematic richness and a multitude of perspectives. Together with the writer’s thorough insight into the culture of former epochs it has also conjured up a grand historical vision.\nBrodsky has experienced what it means to live. “Life … / bares its teeth in a grin at each / encounter.” Through all hardships – trial, internal banishment, exile – he has retained his integrity and his faith in literature and language. There are criteria for human behaviour, he says, which come not from society but from literature.\nThe poet plays a key part as examiner, tester and questioner. Poetry becomes the decisive counterweight against time, the principle of deformation. The poet also becomes the spokesman in the totalitarian society’s apparent silence and the open society’s stupefying flood of information.\nAlthough Brodsky has defined his standpoint distinctly, political disputes are not prominent in him. The problem is raised to a more general level: man’s duty is to live his own life, not a life determined by the categories and norms of others. “Freedom / is when you forget the spelling of the tyrant’s name …”\nWhat could be more natural for a writer than to wrestle with the phenomenon of language? This struggle with his own tool is very intense in Brodsky’s case. It marks his view of poetry and the poet: “Reading [Dostoyevsky] simply makes one realize that stream of consciousness springs not from consciousness but from a word which alters or redirects one’s consciousness”. The ultimate power, he maintains, is “the omnivorousness of his language which eventually comes to a point where it cannot be satisfied with God, man, reality, guilt, death, infinity, salvation … and then it takes on itself.”\nBrodsky’s view of language also characterizes his view of states and societies: “For empires are held together by neither political nor military forces but by languages. – Empires are, first and foremost, cultural entities; and it’s language that does the job, not legions.”\nLanguage of course provides material for metaphors in poetry: “Late evening in Lithuania. / People drift home from mass, hiding the commas / of candles in parentheses of hands”.\nFor Brodsky poetry stands out as a divine gift. The religious dimension that undeniably is to be found in his writings adheres, however, to no particular creed. Metaphysical and ethical questions are paramount, not doctrines.\nStyle and mood alternate in this richly orchestrated poetry. Here is the profound cultural analysis in the essays side by side with the rollicking ironies in the poem\nHistory of the Twentieth Century\n. Yet, for Joseph Brodsky poetry, even in its mirthful moments, is deadly earnest.\nDear Mr. Brodsky,\nIt has been my privilege and pleasure to introduce you to the audience in my native tongue. The gist of what I have said is contained, as it were, in a line from one of your recent poems: “Let me tell you: you are okay”. In fact, you yourself belong to the history of the Twentieth Century alluded to. On behalf of the Swedish Academy I congratulate you on your remarkable achievements.

On the following day Naguib Mahfouz was born in Cairo. The capital of Egypt has remained his home and he has left it only on very rare occasions.\nCairo also provides, time and again, the setting for his novels, short stories and plays. There we find the throng in\nMidaq Alley\n, described in a manner that is both affectionate and translucent. There, in the great novel trilogy, Kamal faces the crucial questions of existence. There lies the houseboat which, in\nChit-chat on the Nile\n, becomes a platform for conversations and animated discussions about social roles. There we meet the young lovers, preparing their bed amidst the blocks of the pyramid.\nIt is vital for a living society to take its authors seriously. They have learnt to\nsee\nin the profoundest sense of the word, exploiting its full potential. This, in fact, represents a fundamental component shared by art and science alike.\nOne approach, among several others, to the works of this year’s Nobel Laureate is to read them as a committed, perceptive, almost prophetic commentary on the world around him. During a long writer’s life, he has witnessed sweeping social changes. Also, his production is uncommonly extensive.\nIn Arabic literature, the novel is actually a 20th-Century phenomenon, more or less contemporary with Mahfouz. And it was he who, in due course, was to bring it to maturity. Some of the milestones are\nMidaq Alley\n,\nThe Trilogy, Children of Gebalawi, The Thief and the Dogs, Chit-Chat on the Nile, Respected Sir\n, and\nMirrors\n. Greatly varied and partly experimental, these novels range from psychological realism to an allegorical and mystic-metaphysical design.\nThe nature of time is one of his basic preoccupations. As for last year’s Nobel Laureate,\nJoseph Brodsky\n, it takes on the character of mercilessness. “Time cuts like a sword”, it says in the novel\nRespected Sir\n. “If you don’t kill it, it kills you.”\nFor the numerous readers that Mahfouz had acquired through\nThe Trilogy\n, with its broad canvas depicting contemporary life,\nChildren of Gebelawi\nmeant quite a surprise. The novel comes out as a spiritual history of mankind,’ presented in as many chapters as there are suras in the Koran, i.e. 114. The great figures of Judaism, Christianity and Islam – although recognizable – appear in disguise, facing new situations charged with tension. The man of modern science mixes, with equal skill, an elixir of love and an explosive. He bears the responsibility for the death of Gebelawi or God – but also perishes himself. Still, there is a glimmer of hope at the end of the novel. Mahfouz is not a pessimist, even though he is occasionally referred to as one. “If I were a pessimist”, he says, “I wouldn’t write.”\nIn the short stories, too, we meet the great existential themes: reason versus faith in God, love as a source of strength in an inexplicable world, the alternatives and limitations to an intellectual attitude, the existential struggle of exposed man.\nTaking authors seriously does not always imply taking them literally. Mahfouz once said that he writes because he has two daughters in need of high-heeled shoes. Unconventional remarks like that may be – and have been – misunderstood. They tell us less about Mahfouz’s literary achievements than about his personality – moderate as well as serious and, at the same time, slyly humorous.\nNaguib Mahfouz has an unrivalled position as spokesman for Arabic prose. Through him, in the cultural sphere to which he belongs, the art of the novel and the short story has attained international standards of excellence, the result of a synthesis of classical Arabic tradition, European inspiration and personal artistry.\nFor private reasons Mr. Mahfouz is unable to join us tonight. However, with your permission I should like to address him directly at this moment, using the medium of vision.\nDear Mr. Mahfouz,\nYour rich and complex work invites us to reconsider the fundamental things in life. Themes like the nature of time and love, society and norms, knowledge and faith recur in a variety of situations and are presented in thought-provoking, evocative, and clearly daring ways. And the poetic quality of your prose can be felt across the language barrier. In the prize citation you are credited with the forming of an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind.

More than almost any writer he was at the center of those agonizing events, both as one of those responsible for them and as a resistance fighter. It was after serving in the trenches, being wounded and lying awhile in field hospitals, after the war was over and he had come home and Spain had embarked on her many dreary years under the new regime, that he made his debut – as a prose writer. In high quarters there was a desire to see edifying books, preferably cheerful and sunny ones. Cela’s first novel was about a multiple murderer who relates his life history before his execution.\nLa familia de Pascual Duarte, Pascual Duarte’s Family\n, was printed secretly in a garage in Burgos in 1942, and by the time it had come to the authorities’ notice the edition was almost sold out. Gradually the censors became resigned; next to Don Quixote it must be the most widely read of all Spanish novels. This story of a matricide can be read as an allegory, a fairy tale about Spain’s monstrous sufferings and furious internal strife.\nIt opened the sluice-gates. Cela’s works grew in range and splendor. If they had anything in common it was the swarms of characters appearing in them; it was hardly a matter of the hierarchy of main characters and secondary ones that is customary in novels. On the stage where the author lets dramas of life and of Spain play themselves out under grim starlight, one could argue, with only slight exaggeration, that there were only secondary characters.\nLa Colmena\nor\nThe Beehive\n, with more than 300 characters, depicts Madrid life during the first sad years of the Franco era. It was Cela’s boldest challenge hitherto to the authorities’ repression of free expression. Although it was translated into many languages, the Spaniards themselves were long denied access to it.\nEighteen years later, in 1969, when Cela published his novel\nSan Camilo 1936\n, the mesh of censorship had numerous gaps and tears in it, so this book was at last published where it was written. To some extent, the Madrid of\nThe Beehive\nstill exists in\nSan Camilo 1936\n, but illumined by streaks of visionary light, and swatched in an apocalyptic glow. The action takes place in Madrid during the week immediately on the eve of the Civil War. Here we encounter the young man with the sad burning eyes, see him mingling with the city’s crowds or staring into the mirror of his own bitter reflections. To a great extent the narrative is an incantation, an exorcization, an invocation, and so it points forward to the work which must be Cela’s most obscure,\nOficio de Tinieblas 5\n– a poetic apocalypse, a major poem eleven hundred and ninety-four verses long, an overall vision of life’s dark absurd anti-logic, arranged in a form similar to the Mass.\nIn\nMazurca para dos Muertos\n, Cela, after his forays into the border lands where language and existence meet chaos, came back to the realities of Spanish life which he had depicted in so many facets. It is an account of the lives of ordinary people in the green and damp Galicia where he lived as a child. But most of all, perhaps, it is a tale about Death, an imagistic fresco depicting the tumult, insanities, comedy and tragedy of human life, always against the background of death, which in the end gathers everything and everyone to itself. Its great, crude humor is part of a tradition that goes back to Aristophanes, Rabelais and Shakespeare, yet it resembles nothing we have ever read in that line.\nIn his classical travel books from the forties and fifties, redolent with a quieter humor, we meet a more gentle pliant Cela; Cela the vagabond, looking for milieux and cultures that at the time were in the process of disappearing.\nAs a whole, what we have before us is an extraordinary rich, weighty and substantial body of writings that possess great wildness, license and violence, but which nonetheless in no way lack sympathy or common human feeling, unless we demand that those sentiments should be expressed in the simplest possible way. Cela has renewed and revitalized the Spanish language as few others have done in our modern age. As a creator of language he is in the tradition of Cervantes, Góngora, Quevedo, Valle-Inclán and Garcia Lorca, Spanish has not really been quite the same language since those writers have put their marks in its great book.\nDear Camilo José Cela,\nI have devoted a few brief minutes to describing a body of work so great and varied as to defy any summary. Your contribution to the rights of creative imagination spans nearly half a century, including long periods under difficult conditions, but in the end it won out. In recent years the wealth of Latin American literature has been widely discussed everywhere. Perhaps too little attention has been paid, however, to its counterpart in the country where Spanish was first spoken.

However, our main focus is on one of its most brilliant representatives: the Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz. The prize citation indicates what is perhaps most immediately striking in his writing: his passion and his integrity. We find them united in the energetic\nnon serviam\n– the refusal to serve – that this poet addresses to various quarters. On one occasion he throws his “no” against the leftist utopia of an all-powerful society, on another his protest is directed against a capitalism lacking ethics and culture. But he also asserts his integrity vis-à-vis the heritage that is so alive to this great humanist – only by confronting tradition can the poet establish a real dialogue with the past.\nPaz’s most familiar “no” is his resignation from the post as the ambassador of his country in New Delhi, in protest against the massacre of demonstrating students in the Plaza de Tlatelolco in 1968. But this outrage is, in his eyes, an outburst emanating from a troublesome past that lives on in our midst. Distant times and distant regions exist in the here and now. Indian and Japanese experience has a presence as natural as the Aztec calendar. Mexico’s great 17th-Century poet is in that way a contemporary: in Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Paz recognizes not only the distinctive Mexican character but also the intellectuals from our century who are transformed, under the pressure of a totalitarian inquisition, into their own prosecutors.\nMost remarkable is how these broad configurations in time and space are condensed in a handful of words. Paz is, in Carlos Fuentes’s phrase, “the great welder.” Throwing off torrents of sparks, his paradoxes link the most differing entities. A central concept is “the eternal moment” – the frequent scene of Paz’s poetry. In the magnificent long poem\nPiedra de sol\n(Sunstone) from 1957 we face a present in flames where “all of the names are a single name,/all of the faces a single face,/all of the centuries a single moment.” It is, we learn, “a moment/chiselled from the dream” – and thus a reminder of the early influences of surrealism, which precisely forced different times, regions, and identities to merge in one single here, now, and I, dictated by the logic of the dream. But Paz is also one of the great love poets of his language and in his central poetry it is less the dream than the sensual communion that overcomes all distinctions, as when the two, “dizzy and entwined, fall/on the grass,” “the sky comes down,” space “nothing but light and silence,” and “we lose our names,” floating adrift between “blue and green” in “total time” (\nPiedra de sol\n). Also in the latest collection of poems,\nÁrbol adentro\n(A Tree Within), love can in this way erase what limits us: it opens “the forbidden door” and “takes us to the other side of time.”\nOf special importance is the welding together of thought and sensuousness. This is a great theme in modern poetry.\nT.S. Eliot\nthus went back to the English 17th-Century poets who could still “feel their thoughts as immediately as the odour of a rose”. In a similar way, Paz draws strength from the original Indian poetry of his country in his striving for the “sensuous intelligence” indicated by the prize citation. “Reason is incarnated at last,” as he says in a poem from 1948. By welding together thinking and sensuousness Paz can give an immediate palpability to his continuous reflection on poetry, both when he participates in the mission of “spelling” the world, giving it a name and thereby a visibility, and when, as a reader, he finds himself watched from the whispering “foliage of the letters” (\nPasado en claro\n). With such a method he can depict time in all its obtrusive ominousness, and give love power to surmount it.\nDear Dr. Paz,\nIt has been my task to give a picture of your writing in a few minutes. It is like trying to press a continent into a walnut shell – a feat for which the language of criticism is poorly equipped. This is, however, what you have managed to do, again and again, in poems which have, quite rightly, an improbably high specific gravity. I am happy to convey the cordial congratulations of the Swedish Academy to a writer of such substance.

If art is freedom, she asks, how could it exist within the oppressors?\nNadine Gordimer agrees with last year’s Laureate,\nOctavio Paz\n, in asserting the importance of regaining the meanings of words, as a first step in the critical process. She has had the courage to write as if censorship did not exist, and so has seen her books banned, time after time.\nAbove all, it is people, individual men and women, that have captured her and been captured by her. It is their lives, their heaven and hell, that absorb her. The outer reality is ever present, but it is through her characters that the whole historical process is crystallized.\nConveying to the reader a powerful sense of authenticity, and with wide human relevance, she makes visible the extremely complicated and utterly inhuman living conditions in the world of racial segregation. She feels political responsibility, and does not shy away from its consequences, but will not allow it to affect her as a writer: her texts are not agitatorial, not progandistic. Still, her works and the deep insights she offers contribute to shaping reality.\nIn one of her great novels we meet Maureen, the stronger of husband and wife in a family who, with the help of their boy, have fled the fighting, taking refuge in a hut in his native village. Here, gradually, the strains on their mode of life, language and everyday relations become unbearable. One day Maureen notices a helicopter landing. She does not know whether it brings friends or enemies but, stricken with unspeakable horror, she instinctively leaves the hut and starts running towards the sound. She runs ever faster and more frantically. She runs with all the suppressed trust of a lifetime. She runs for her survival, the enemy of all responsibility.\nThis is the closing scene of the novel. Were there still possibilities ahead of her? Or was this the very end? To Maureen and what she stands for, the future appears to hold out the opposite of utopia, a dystopia. This is not Nadine Gordimer’s only vision, but it is one which she has found it necessary to give expression to.\nIn this way, artistry and morality fuse.\nPeople are more important than principles.\nA truly living human being cannot remain neutral.\nNo one is in possession of all goodness, and no one has a monopoly of evil.\nIrony does not need any prompting.\nChildren who meet, gladly meet halfway.\nThe power of love makes the mountain tremble.\nThoughts and impressions such as these are called forth by novels like\nA Guest of Honour\n,\nThe Conservationist, Burger’s Daughter, July’s People\n, and\nMy Son’s Story\n. However, in a manner as absorbing as in her novels, Nadine Gordimer develops her penetrating depiction of character, her compassion and her powers of precise wording in her short stories, in collections like\nSix Feet of the Country\nand, as yet untranslated,\nA Soldier’s Embrace\nand\nSomething Out There\n.\nYour Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is remarkable how often Nadine Gordimer succeeds in her artistic intent – to burn a hole through the page.\nDear Miss Gordimer,\nNinety years ago, the prize citation mentioned “the qualities of both heart and intellect”. Indeed, these words apply no less today when the Swedish Academy points to the Nobelian concept of outstanding literary achievement as an important means of conferring benefit on mankind, in terms of human value and freedom of speech.

His friend\nJoseph Brodsky\nlifts out one of them in his analysis of the work:\nI’m just a red nigger who love the sea,\nI had a sound colonial education,\nI have Dutch, nigger, and English in me,\nand either I’m nobody, or I’m a nation.\nThese lines in\nThe Star-Apple Kingdom\ncall to mind, in the first place, how Walcott unites white and black on his father’s as well as on his mother’s side but they also remind us of the fact that in his poetry he amalgamates material from different cultures, West Indian, African, and European.\nIt does not, however, stop at the mingled voices of heritage or the union of themes from different parts of the world. In his introduction to the first volume of plays, we find another Walcott word of great validity – “the mulatto of style”. Walcott’s art arises from the crossing of two greatly differing traditions, the first a tradition he allowed himself to be adopted by, the European lineage from Homer via Dante, the Elizabethans, and Milton to Auden and Dylan Thomas, an elaborate tradition discernible in lavish metaphor and luxurious sound and rhythm, the second a domestic ageless tradition, an elementary language where, like a new Adam, the poet gives things their names, perceiving how the speech sounds take shape – as in a passage in the autobiographical\nAnother Life\n: “I watched the vowels curl from the tongue of the carpenter’s plane,/resinous, fragrant … “Derek Walcott’s extraordinary idiom is born in the meeting between European virtuosity and the sensuality of the Caribbean Adam.\nBut this very personal combination includes not only themes and language. It is also a question of historical outlook. And here we are helped by yet another formula – “the New Aegean”. The archipelago in focus is a reincarnation of the Aegean one: Greek antiquity finds a natural home in the Caribbean present. This can of course be most distinctly seen in Walcott’s latest work,\nOmeros\n, his mosaic epic about the fisherman Achille and his ex-colleague the taxi driver Hector fighting for the favour of the fair housemaid Helen. But the Homeric pattern in this poem is not unique. In fact,\nOmeros\nhas been emerging all through Walcott’s production, appearing again and again in names and themes and continuously present in the Odyssean surging of the waves.\nWhat carries the ancient murmur into today’s Caribbean, what makes history present is the sea. “The Sea is History” – in a magnificent poem with that name, the sea can allow “the plangent harps of the Babylonian bondage” to sound in the West Indies, where slavery is still manifest in the memories of the skin.\nWalcott’s latest major poem abundantly exemplifies the combination of a vertiginous historical panorama and morning-fresh Caribbean now. But I should like to illustrate his art of capturing an enormous perspective of time in the tangible moment by means of a few lines in the previous volume,\nThe Arkansas Testament\n. The associations of the poem’s self-contemptuous ego at his shabby motel run to Saul on his way to Damascus:\nOn the far side of the highway,\na breeze turned the leaves of an aspen\nto the First Epistle of Paul’s\nto the Corinthians.\nThis wind, which miraculously transforms the leaves of the tree into the pages with St. Paul’s commandment of love, is more than an ingenious allusion to a moment where revelation changed history. The breeze pulling an age long since past into the now of the senses, captures, at the same time, a theme that has been sounding for a few decades in Derek Walcott’s production – a Pauline empathy vigorous enough to cross centuries and continents.\nDear Derek Walcott,\nIn your last book, God allows one of your protagonists to be guided by a sea-swift across the ocean, back to his African origin. The quick divine movement of this pilot bird through space and time embodies the thrill given by your poetic art. As a great admirer of that art, I am happy to convey to you, on behalf of the Swedish Academy, the warmest congratulation on the Nobel Prize in Literature 1992 and to invite you to receive the Prize from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nFrom\n, Literature 1991-1995\n, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1997\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

This year it has been granted to Toni Morrison, making her the ninetieth Nobel Laureate in Literature.\nIn her volume of essays,\nPlaying in the Dark\n, Miss Morrison lucidly pictures the insights that she has gained, as an author and a reader in her native country: “It is as if I had been looking at a fishbowl – the glide and flick of the golden scales, the green tip, the bolt of white careening back from the gills; the castles at the bottom, surrounded by pebbles and tiny, intricate fronds of green; the barely disturbed water, the flecks of waste and food, the tranquil bubbles travelling to the surface – and suddenly I saw the bowl, the structure that transparently (and invisibly) permits the ordered life it contains to exist in the larger world.” In other words, she regards the African presence in her country as a vital but unarticulated prerequisite for the fulfilment of the American dream. Similarly, she sees whiteness in literature as having blackness as its constant companion, the racial other as its shadow.\nIn her depictions of the world of the black people, in life as in legend, Toni Morrison has given the Afro-American people their history back, piece by piece. In this perspective, her work is uncommonly consonant. At the same time, it is richly variegated. The reader derives vast pleasure from her superb narrative technique, shifting from novel to novel and marked by original development, although it is related to\nFaulkner\nand to the Latin American tradition. Toni Morrison’s novels invite the reader to partake at many levels, and at varying degrees of complexity. Still, the most enduring impression they leave is of empathy, compassion with one’s fellow human beings.\nMilkman Dead, the protagonist of\nSong of Solomon\n, reflects one of the basic themes of Miss Morrison’s novels, in his quest for self. Milkman’s paternal grandfather was a liberated slave. When he was registering his freedom, he responded to a question about his father with the word “Dead”, thus acquiring his macabre surname from the drunken official who asked. His family was prepared to accept this name: “It was new and would wipe out the past. Wipe it all out.” The Solomon whose name occurs in the title of the novel, Milkman’s peculiar southern forefather, was to be found even in the song that went with children’s games. The intensity of his inner life had carried him through the air back to the Africa of his origins. Solomon’s rapture was ultimately Milkman’s as well.\nMotifs in space and time continue to be interwoven in\nBeloved\n. Paradoxically, the combination of realism and folklore enhances the novel’s credibility. In the world which the female protagonist, Sethe, inhabits, one does not possess one’s own body. There is tremendous power in Toni Morrison’s description of Sethe’s act of releasing her child, Beloved, from the destiny she imagines her facing, and of the consequences of this act for her own life, in which Beloved’s double personifies the burden of Sethe’s guilt.\nIn her latest novel,\nJazz\n, Toni Morrison’s approach is similar to the style in which jazz is performed. The opening lines of the novel state its theme, the lives of a number of people in Harlem in the 1920s. In the course of the novel we perceive a first-person narrator, varying, supplementing and intensifying the story. The final picture is a highly composite image of events, characters and atmospheres, mediated in sensual language with a deep inherent sense of musicality. Toni Morrison’s way of addressing her reader has a compelling lustre, in a poetic direction.\nWhen she was very young, her family’s landlord set fire to the house in which they lived when her parents fell behind with the rent. And while they were in it. Her family reacted to this absurd form of crudeness, monumental crudeness, not with resignation but with laughter. This, says Toni Morrison, is how you can distance yourself from the act and take your life back. You take your integrity back.\nIn great minds, gravity and humour are close neighbours. This is reflected in everything Toni Morrison has written, and evidenced in her own summary: “My project rises from delight, not disappointment.”\nDear Miss Morrison,\nI have just told the audience that, in your own words, your project rises from delight, not disappointment. As you disclose fundamental aspects of hidden reality, you make gravity and humour abide side by side in your remarkable work, with its verbal music. It is my privilege and pleasure, on behalf of the Swedish Academy, to convey to you our warmest congratulations on the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1993, and to invite you to receive the Prize from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nFrom\n, Literature 1991-1995\n, Editor Sture Allén, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1997\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The narrator, Mitsu, living in a marriage which has not survived the birth of a child with serious brain damage, has returned to the Shikoku of his childhood with his younger brother, Takashi, a hardline activist, who dreams of a martyr’s death. They are back in the isolated valley in which their ancestors once found refuge in a critical situation. One night Mitsu witnesses how his brother, stark naked, runs round in circles in the newly-fallen snow, and then rolls over and over in the snow-drifts with obvious signs of sexual excitement. Takashi is at one and the same time both the narrator’s great-grandfather’s brother, and also his own; he is both the leader of a rebellion which took place a century earlier, and the instigator of present-day riots: “every moment of those hundred years was crowded into this one instant in time”.\nFrom one point of view the scene allows us a glimpse of Oe’s narrative mastery: unerringly he carries a series of events in two time planes to its tragic culmination. From another point of view, the passage is an example of the past breaking into the present, making the figures resume and vary an earlier line of action. In Oe’s work, a number of such challenges from the past again and again evoke new answers. We have just been reminded of the escape of the ancestors to the secluded valley, the rebellion of a century earlier, the tension between the mismatched brothers, and the shock caused by the child’s deformity. Nuclear catastrophe is another such theme, readily linked to the theme of the brain-damaged son. Certain philosophical elements persist as well, coloured by Oe’s early readings of\nSartre\n, such as the absurdity of life, the inescapability of responsibility, and human dignity. But Oe also insists on another point: undefined and inaccessible reality demands a “model” if it is to be perceived by the senses.\nThe incessant re-emergences are, however, linked to a great project, whose features and dimensions have gradually taken form. Books like\nA Personal Matter\n,\nThe Silent Cry\nas well as\nM/T and the Tale of the Wonders of the Forest\nare, together with the short stories, works that fall into their proper places when we read the novel that was published in French last year under the title\nLettres aux Années de Nostalgic\n. Here Oe exploits the device of the Japanese first-person novel to create the illusion of an autobiography. In reality the book – we are told in an interview – is 80 percent fiction. Brother Gii, who is presented to us as the dominant figure in the narrator’s life, is thus a literary invention, a counter-figure who embodies the latter’s dream of remaining in the woodland of his ancestors, reading Dante. The earlier books now assume their rightful places in this new context which reveals them in a new light. In\nThe Silent Cry\n, for example, occurs a transformation of the crime which once gave Gii ten years in prison, but also a revision of his material about the life of their ancestors.\nIn Oe’s work, therefore, we are dealing with more than persistent leitmotifs. The books re-echo and vary each other in a great ingenious project. Here, if ever, it is justifiable to talk about a writer who is not writing books but “building” an œuvre. And we can add that once again Oe inverts his material in a new novel in which the symbiosis between a father and his spiritually clouded son is focused on anew – a book that paradoxically ends with the word “Rejoice!”.\nThis may sound like a rigidly planned structure but that is not at all what the text looks like. It rather seems as if this stubborn enterprise is the outcome of a poetic obsession. Oe himself has described his writing as a way of exorcising his demons. Hopefully, he will never succeed. But from his incessant wrestling with these risky beings derives an œuvre which succeeds in another way – in escaping the bounds of the author’s intentions. Oe has declared that he addresses only his Japanese readers, without glancing at his worldwide audience. But there is in his “grotesque realism” a powerful poetry which communicates across the boundaries of languages and cultures, a poetry full of fresh observations and concise images. The furious persistence, as well, with which he returns to his motifs erases these barriers: eventually we become familiar with his figures, marvel at their transformations, and are enticed into sharing the author’s view that no truth, no picture is valid once and for all. Validity exists on another level. Out of this multitude of people and events in ever-changing shapes there rises in the end the vision of a genuine humanist, a poignant picture of that which concerns us all.\nDear Mr. Oe,\nYou have claimed that reality demands a “model” if it is to be grasped by our senses. Your books offer, indeed, such a “model”, enabling us to see the interaction of time present and time past, of relentless change and persistent myth, and to distinguish man’s delicate position in the context.

The thatched farmhouse he grew up in was called Mossbawn   – a name that has become mythical in Heaney’s poetry. It is a   place that occurs and re-occurs in concrete nearness in Heaney’s   poetry, from his debut in 1966 with\nDeath of a Naturalist\nuntil\nSeeing Things\n, the most recent, published in 1991.   As an example of his choice of subject matter and his style, one   can choose the opening lines of “A drink of water”, from\nField   Work\npublished in 1979: “She came every morning to draw   water/Like an old bat staggering up the field:/The pump’s   whooping cough, the bucket’s clatter/And slow diminuendo as it   filled,/Announced her.”\nIt is no pastoral idyll that Seamus Heaney   conjures up, but rather the toilsome, lethargic greyness of the   diurnal. Like Wordsworth, Seamus Heaney can well describe each   human being as “a Child of Earth”. For Seamus Heaney, poetry,   like the soil, is evidently something to be ploughed and turned   over.\nThe poet has little time for the Emerald   Isle of the tourist brochures. For him Ireland is first and   foremost\nThe Bogland\n.\nHeaney sees Ireland’s peat bogs as a symbol   of its identity, just as the potato is – with all that this   recalls of the suffering during The Great Hunger in the middle of   the 19th century.\nThe peat bogs also evoke, in their special   way, the feeling of the past. One of Seamus Heaney’s most   expressive poems accounts for his experience of the Iron Age   Tollund Man, whose body was preserved in a peat bog in Jutland.   In his figure Heaney conjures forth, brutally and movingly, a   culture that is both alien and familiar, a distinctive subject of   ritual sacrifice, human voices silenced by the boggy   landscape.\nThe water in the peat bogs, indeed all   water, is something Seamus Heaney associates with the feminine,   the Gaelic, the Catholic, the creative element in his nature. All   this is deeply grounded in the poet’s very being, a childhood   preserved – as it were – which has not been overshadowed by his   secularised British upbringing or the bitter experiences of The   Troubles, the conflict in Ulster. In this context it must be said   that Seamus Heaney never reduces reality to a matter of political   slogans, he writes about the fates of individuals, of personal   friends who have been afflicted by the heedless violence – in the   background somewhere there is Dante, who could yoke the political   to the transcendental.\nHeaney also has links with the academic   world. He has taught in Belfast and Dublin, he has been Professor   of Poetry at Oxford, and since 1982 he has been teaching rhetoric   and oratory at Harvard in the United States.\nSeamus Heaney comes from a humble, farming   community, but at the same time we meet in him a learned poet who   in the very microcosm of language cultivates and reveals the   Celtic, pre-Christian and Catholic literary heritage. He does   this in his poetry, and in five collections of eminently readable   essays, including\nThe Government of the Tongue\n(1968),\nThe Place of Writing\n(1989) and\nThe Redress of   Poetry\n– the volume published this year that contains the   lectures he gave at Oxford.\nIn his essays and meditations, Heaney also   specifies the poetic turning points which arose from   confrontation with some remarkable poets – British, Irish,   American and European – not infrequently in the spirit of his   compatriot and great predecessor Patrick Kavanagh’s principle:   the local can articulate the universal… God is in the bits and   pieces of the Everyday.\nDear Seamus Heaney,\nI have just given the audience some “bits and pieces” about   reality and symbol in your poems. Let me now remind you of your   own Declaration of Independence – Poetry can never be reduced to   a political, historical or moral issue. In the final resort   poetry is its own reality. Ever since\nDeath of a   Naturalist\nI have admired the way in which you turn your back   on the systematisers, to defend instead poetic creativity as a   free, natural, biological process. We all admire your revealing   and compelling images and rhythms, we are gladdened by your quest   for sacred wells and the sudden eruption of Beauty.

How are we to live after the great   disillusionment? With what means shall we arrive at values, by   what path reach an authentic conception of life that is no longer   distorted?\n“Aesthetics is the mother of ethics”,\nBrodsky\nsays.   Or: “If mankind’s negative potential expresses itself in murder,   its positive potential manifests itself best in art.”\nDuring the long period of the ideological   recasting of human consciousness, which we have just left behind   us, some of Polish postwar poetry emerged as a sign of hope, a   sewage treatment plant for mutilated and contaminated language –   thus for the life of the mind and the perception of life as well.   In the mere existence of poetic language, in the patient   word-work of distinguishing genuine from sham, false tone from   true, an entire society’s purification process functioned and   continues to function slowly, invisibly, underground.\nIn Wislawa Szymborska the Swedish Academy   wants to honour a representative – and a representative of   unusual and unyielding purity and strength – of a poetic outlook.   Of poetry as a response to life, a way of life, of the word-work   as thought and responsibility.\nWislawa Szymborska’s making of poems is the   perfection of the word-object, of the exquisitely chiseled   thought-image –\nallegro ma non troppo\n, as one of her poems   is called. But a darkness that is never directly touched is   perceptible, just as the movement of blood under the skin. For   Szymborska, as for many other contemporary Polish poets, the   starting point is the experience of a catastrophe, the ground   caving in beneath her, the complete collapse of a faith. In its   place human conditions break in with their inaccessibly   shimmering agitation, their dailiness and pettiness, their tears   and their jests, their tenderness. These conditions demand their   particular language, a language that makes things relative, a   language that methodically starts from scratch. The path of   language is through negation – the prerequisite for being able to   build anew is to build from nothing. From that point a game of   role-playing begins, the wonderful dramaturgy of the world:\nLife (I say) I’ve no idea\nwhat I could compare you to.\nA devotion to the mystery of surface begins   here – perhaps paradoxically, perhaps the necessary   life-sustaining paradox – and becomes one of the many languages   of changing roles, one of the many capricious harlequin languages   of transformation and identification.\nIn Szymborska surface is depth, the path of   negation has the effect of a quiet but tremendous explosion of   being. “My identifying features / are rapture and despair”. The   farther in one travels among the clear mirrors of her language   pictures – crystalline clarity that in some way exists to lead   one to a final enigma – the more one feels the world’s obtrusive   unambiguousness being transformed. A shimmer of wonder and of   particulars hovers over the world’s motionless base of rock, to   whom she gives voice:\n“I don’t have a door”, says the stone.\nI would sum up Wislawa Szymborska’s   undertaking as a deeply transformative word-work with the state   of the world. One that is best summarized in her own words in the   poem\nDiscovery\n:\nI believe in the refusal to take part.\nI believe in the ruined career.\nI believe in the wasted years of work.\nI believe in the secret taken to the grave.\nThese words soar for me beyond all rules\nwithout seeking support from actual examples.\nMy faith is strong, blind, and without foundation.\nDear Wislawa Szymborska,\nI am happy to convey to you, on behalf of The Swedish Academy,   our warmest congratulations on the Nobel Prize in Literature for   1996 and to invite you to receive the prize from the hands of His   Majesty the King.\n*Translated from   Swedish by Rika Lesser.

Swedish   mediaeval laws stipulated that it cost a man smaller fines to lay   violent hands on somebody from a neighbouring county than on a   man from his own part of the country; but to assault a jester, on   the other hand, cost him nothing at all. If a jester is beaten   up, says the thirteenth-century law concerning such people, it   shall not be counted an offence. If a jester comes to bodily   harm, he shall have and suffer what was given him – infamy and   injury. “Let him never appeal for more justice than a thral woman   lashed on her bare back.”\nOne of Dario Fo’s sources of inspiration is   exactly these mediaeval jesters, unprotected by any law.   According to Fo satire is what makes the most forceful impact on   man. Mixing laughter and seriousness is his way of telling the   truth about abuses and unrighteousness. For Alfred Nobel literary   achievements were important means for fulfilling the fundamental   aim of the awards, namely to confer benefit on mankind. The   maintenance of human dignity is unquestionably an essential   aspect of this.\nFo often refers explicitly to the mediaeval   joculatores and their comedy and mysteries. In fact, a central   work in his oeuvre, “Mistero buffo” – “The Comic Mysteries” – is   based on old material culled from many different quarters. In the   scene called “The Birth of the Jester” the crucial moment occurs   when a landlord avid for more land violates the wife of the man   who is breaking untilled ground. “The Marriage at Cana” is seen   from the point of view of the intoxicated wine-drinker. In “The   Resurrection of Lazarus” the provocative question is whether   Jesus will succeed.\nThere are several other sources. Furthest   away in time we seem to glimpse Plautus and Terence in Rome, who   were of renewed interest in fifteenth century Italy. The commedia   dell’arte, a creation of the sixteenth century, is of importance   with its set-character parts and its oral tradition. It is also   possible to catch a sly glance from Bottom the weaver and Sir   Andrew Aguecheek. Impulses from our own days come from   Maiakovski’s epic-satirical poetry and from Brecht’s didactic   theatre. Incidentally, it was from Maiakovski that Fo borrowed   the title “Mistero Buffo”.\nAnother major achievement in Fo’s large   production is “Accidental Death of an Anarchist”. The play is   about the cross-examining following on the supposed accident. By   and by the questioning is taken over, through a brilliantly   carried out shift, by a Hamlet-like figure – il Matto – who has   the kind of madness that exposes official falsehoods. All in all   there are many topical allusions in Fo’s plays, but the texts   transcend everyday situations and are given a far wider range of   application.\nOne cannot hold it against Fo that he is a   first-rate actor. The decisive thing is that he has written plays   which arouse the enthusiasm of actors and which captivate his   audiences. The texts are chiselled in an interplay with the   spectators and have often been given their final shape over a   long time. Rapidly changing situations give impetus to the plays   and shape the characters. The rhythm of the actors’ lines, the   witty wording and the aptitude for improvisation combine with   strong intensity and artistic energy in the profoundly   meaningful, steady flow of his flashes of wit. The printed texts   can also give you this feeling it you give free range to your   imagination. Fo’s work brings to the fore the multifarious   abundance of the literary field.\nHis independence and perspicacity have made   him run great risks and right enough he has been made to   experience the consequences both at home and abroad. When on one   occasion he and his wife, Franca Rame, had been stopped from   making an agreed-on appearance abroad, their friends and   colleagues arranged a representation which they called “An   Evening without Dario Fo and Franca Rame”.\nLooking backwards in time from Dario Fo,   the ninety-fourth laureate for literature, to earlier writers   given the award, it is tempting to arrest oneself at\nGeorge Bernard Shaw\n,   winner of the Prize seventy years ago. On that occasion the   Swedish Academy emphasised the laureate’s idealism, humanity, and   stimulating satire. The two writers are no doubt different from   each other, but the same evaluative words can be applied to Dario   Fo.\nDear Mr. Fo,\nThe word dignity plays an important part in your oeuvre and is at   the centre of the piece called “The Birth of the Jester”. The   dignity bestowed on you today may have other attributes, but it   has the same core. On behalf of the Swedish Academy I   congratulate you warmly on the work which has resulted in the   Nobel Prize in Literature 1997 and I ask you to step forward to   receive the prize from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nFrom\nLes Prix Nobel\n.

Book succeeds book, in progress towards a coherent picture of the world. José Saramago belongs to the opposite category, writers who repeatedly seem to want to invent both a world and a style that is new. In his novel\nThe Stone Raft\n, he makes the Iberian peninsula separate and drift out into the Atlantic, an opening that provides a wealth of possibilities for a satirical description of society. But in his next book,\nThe History of the Siege of Lisbon,\nno trace of this geological catastrophe is to be found.\nIn Blindness: a Novel,\nthe epidemic that deprives people of their sight is confined between the covers of the work. In his next novel\nAll the Names,\nat the Population Registration Office nothing has been heard of any rampant spread of blindness, nor in previous works has there been anything to suggest the existence of this chillingly all-embracing agency. It is not Saramago’s ambition to portray a coherent universe. On the contrary, he seems every time to be trying out a new model to apprehend an evasive reality, fully aware that each model is a crude approximation that could permit other approximate values, indeed one that requires them. He explicitly condemns anything that claims to be “the only version”; it is merely “another version among many”. There is no overriding truth. Saramago’s apparently contradictory images of the world have to be placed alongside each other to provide their own alternative accounts of an existence that is fundamentally protean and unfathomable.\nIn each and every one of these versions, the rules of common sense are suspended in some way. This is not uncommon in recent fiction. But here we are dealing with something different from narrative in which anything can happen – and does so all the time. Saramago has adopted a demanding artistic discipline which allows the laws of nature or common sense to be violated in one decisive respect only, and which then follows the consequences of this irrationality with all the logical rationality and exact observation it is capable of. In his novel\nThe Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,\nhe makes a flesh and blood character of a figure that has only existed in the imaginary world, one of the guises adopted by the poet Pessoa. But this miracle gives rise to a masterfully realistic picture of Lisbon in the 1930s. Again, the severance of the Iberian peninsula that allows it to drift off into the Atlantic is a one-off violation of the natural order; what follows is a hilariously precise description of the consequences of this absurd aberration. In\nThe History of the Siege of Lisbon\nthe accepted order of things is subverted more discreetly. A proof-reader introduces a “not” into a book about the war of liberation against the Moors, thus altering the course of history. As penance he is made to write an alternative history that delineates the consequences of his amendment; this is once again a version that denies any claim to be the only valid one. In the same spirit, Saramago has also published a new, wonderful version of the narrative of the gospels, a version in which the contravention of the expected order is to be found in God’s petty hunger for power so that the role of Jesus is redefined as one of defiance. Perhaps the greatest scope allowed to the fantastic is in\nBaltasar and Blimunda\nwhere the clairvoyant heroine gathers up the wills of the dying – energy that makes the aerial voyage in the book possible. But she too and her love are placed in an objectively described historical process, in this case the construction of the convent at Mafra that cost so much human suffering.\nThis rich work, with its constantly shifting perspectives and constantly renewed images of the world, is held together by a narrator whose voice is with us all the time. Apparently he is a story-teller of the old-fashioned omniscient variety, a master of ceremonies standing on the stage next to his creations, commenting on them, guiding their steps and sometimes winking at us across the footlights. But Saramago uses these traditional techniques with amused distance. The narrator is also adept in the contemporary devices of the absurd and develops a modern scepticism when faced with the omniscient claim to be able to say how things stand.The result is literature characterised at one and the same time by sagacious reflection and by insight into the limitations of sagacity, by the fantastic and by precise realism, by cautious empathy and by critical acuity, by warmth and by irony. This is Saramago’s unique amalgam.\nDear José Saramago,\nAnybody who tries in a few minutes to portray your work will end up articulating a series of paradoxes. You have created a cosmos that does not want to be a coherent universe. You have given us ingenious versions of a history that will not allow itself to be taken captive. You have taken the stage as the kind of narrator we feel we have long been familiar with – but with all of our contemporary liberties at your fingertips and imbued with contemporary scepticism about definite knowledge. Your distinguishing mark is irony coupled with discerning empathy, distance without distance. It is my hope that this award will attract many people to your rich and complex world.

We are told that it has been reduced to entertainment   or to a hobby for an isolated elite. But just as a philosopher in   ancient Greece, wishing to reject the Eleatic theory that motion   is impossible, simply walked about in front of the Eleatics   meeting place in the hall of pillars, so having\nGünter Grass\npresent is enough to make us realize that literature will not   easily be pushed to the margin.\nPublication of\nThe Tin Drum\nmeant a second birth for the   German novel of the twentieth century. Not since\nThomas Mann\n‘s\nBuddenbrooks\nhad a first book caused such a stir. This   kind of attention has its price. Just like Mann, Grass later met   with the reproach that, after being so loved by readers and   critics, he had the audacity to write … differently. In Thomas   Mann’s case, this reproach turned up even in the Swedish   Academy’s citation for his Nobel Prize in 1929. The 1999 citation   contains no such reservation.\nTo the merits of Günter Grass belong not only his creation   of a narrative carnival like\nThe Tin Drum,\nbut also the   fact that he hasn’t spent his life trying to repeat this feat.   Time and again, he has left behind the established critical   measures of his greatness and ventured with astonishing liberty   into new undertakings. He has set himself above prohibitions and   expectations, esthetical as well as political. He continues to do   in the newest texts that have come from his workshop.\nIt’s often said that, with\nThe Tin Drum,\nGrass saved a   vanished world from oblivion – the town of Danzig as it existed   before the Nazis and the war. But readers intent on a magical   time tour should perhaps rather read\nCat and Mouse,\nthe   short story in which the friendships of boyhood are recalled with   the keenness of loss and guilt.\nThe Tin Drum,\nhowever, is   something else. It seems to stage the very march of history with   a formidable array of characters and tall stories. But everything   is viewed from an unusually low position a yard above the ground.\nThe Tin Drum\nhas its temper from a first person narrator   who resembles nothing in literature or on earth. Regardless of   all the tricksters of folklore, regardless of mythical infants   equipped with the wisdom of old men, regardless of Shakespeare’s   Puck and Hoffmann’s Kleinzach, Oskar Matzerath is a completely   original creation: an infernal intelligence in the body of a   three-year old, a monster who victoriously approaches mankind   with the aid of a tin drum, an intellectual with infantility as   his critical method. If, as one voice in the novel suggests, our   time could wear the motto “Mysticism, barbarism, gloom,” then   Oskar is its sworn enemy. From Dadaism and another cheerfully   destructive avant-garde groups of the beginning of our century,   he has inherited the creative irreverence, but, unlike them,   hasn’t jettisoned reason.\nOther German writers – I’m thinking of Arno Schmidt and\nHeinrich   Böll\n– portrayed the collapse of human values as   apocalypse or tragedy. Grass preferred a literary method more   akin to the one adopted by the anonymous parodist who, sometime   after Homer, depicted martial heroism as the battle between the   frogs and the mice. Grass broke the spell that lay over the   German past and sabotaged the German sublime, the taste for the   somberly blazing magnificence of foredoomed destruction. This was   an achievement far more radical than all the ideological   criticism directed against Nazism. Grass’s novels strip their   characters of grand words and emphasize the solidity of the flesh   by bringing human forms close to the animal world. We all have a   place in his menagerie of cat and mouse, dog, snail, flounder,   frog and scarecrow.\nThe different books that followed – the feverish\nDog   Years,\nthe patiently arguing diary novels from the period   when the author was engaged in party politics, the great fables   of the seventies and eighties and so on – taught us to read   in a new way, with our ears and stomachs just as much as with our   eyes and brains. Günter Grass in his expansive phrases   brings together not only the high and the low but also the   subject and its distorted representation in general opinion, that   spiteful mutter for which no one is responsible and of which no   one is innocent. His text displays not the homophony of letters   but the polyphony of orality, like a noisy inn where a voice is   raised without necessarily silencing friends and opponents. His   irony has as many shades as his graphic prints.\nThe major codes of his work – animals and food – meet in\nThe   Flounder,\na great novel of the formation and malformation of   civilization. The author musters the courage to engage in a   dialogue with feminism, and attempts a new version of the history   of progress, here told as the story of how eminent female cooks   taught the people to feed on appetizing and wholesome dishes.   With the serious motto that you mustn’t cook without historical   consciousness, Grass develops a mode of thinking one would like   to call\ngastrosophy.\nIn his much-debated\nEin weites Feld\n– Grass takes the   daring step of giving an undramatic view of the relationship   between the henchmen of totalitarianism and its victims. He plays   off the eternal humanist against the eternal police informer,   sympathetic understanding against the endless inquisition that   keeps prying into old mistakes even beyond the grave. Of the two   main characters he says: “Seen from the front, they looked very   ill-matched, from behind however, as fitting to each other as two   pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.” There is something so hilariously   insolent, independent and relativistic in Grass’s rendering of   life in Berlin around the Fall of the Wall, that he was bound to   infuriate many readers of his home country.\nGünter Grass! Your sense of proportion has done mankind a   genuine service. Your new book has the title\nMein   Jahrhundert\n– My Century. The fact that you are receiving the   twentieth century’s last Nobel Literature Prize is confirmation   of the reasonableness of such a title. In your cavalcade of the   past hundred years, you give ample proof of your uncanny ability   to impersonate the voices of the thoughtless: all those bewitched   by the hopes of politics and technology, rendered stupid by the   great perspectives. The core of thoughtlessness is enthusiasm. I   read\nMein Jahrhundert\nas a critique of enthusiasm and a   celebration of its opposite, a good memory. Your style, with its   repetitions and specifications and stratification of different   voices, tells us that we shall not be in a hurry either when   dealing with the past or when dealing with the future. You have   shown that as long as literature remembers what people hasten to   forget, it remains a power to be reckoned with.\nI would like to express the warm congratulations of the Swedish   Academy as I now request you to receive the Nobel Prize for   Literature from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Born in 1940, he began his career as a writer as early as the                  sixties. His production would certainly have been much larger                  had not the conditions of life during the Cultural Revolution                  forced him to burn all his manuscripts of the sixties and the                  seventies. He also made very important contributions to the theoretical                  debate concerning the structure and functions of drama and the                  novel in China during the eighties. His work as a breaker of new                  ground relates to the form and structure of a literary work as                  well as to its psychological foundations.\nThe novel called\nSoul Mountain\n(1990) stands out as one of                the foremost works in twentieth-century Chinese literature. Among                many other things Gao Xingjian deals in it with an existential dilemma:                man’s urge to find the absolute independence granted by solitude                conflicts with a longing for the warmth and fellowship which can                be given by “the other,” be it he or she. At the same time, however,                this enriching companionship threatens the individual’s integrity                and, without fail, ends in some kind of struggle for power.\nThe author’s vivid sense of alienation in a politics-ridden society                  made him, in the early eighties, go in search for hidden-away                  parts of southwestern and southern China, where there still existed                  traces of primitive cultures, age-old shamanistic rites and Daoist                  notions. In his portrayal of these cultures, replete with fantastic                  cock-and-bull stories which bring to the reader’s mind the repertoires                  of traditional storytellers, he also castigates strict Confucian                  orthodoxy as well as Marxist ideology and their respective demands                  for obedience and uniformity.\nIn the course of his pilgrimage to\nSoul Mountain,\nwhere he hopes to find the ultimate truth about the meaning of                  life and the human condition, the author’s ego is stricken by                  loneliness and is forced into creating a\nyou,\na projection                  of itself, which, in turn, hit by the same loneliness, creates                  a\nshe.\nThe numerous\nhe\nfigures that                  make their appearance in the novel are likewise projections of                  the author’s ego. With the help of these pronominal projections,                  the author manages to investigate a wide range of human relationships                  and their consequences for the individual.\nThe novel entitled\nOne Man’s Bible\n(1999), which Gao Xingjian                himself looks upon as a companion novel to Soul Mountain, is a novel                of confession in which he mercilessly lays bare the three different                parts he played during the Cultural Revolution: as a leader of a                rebel faction, as a victim and as a silent observer. Again he makes                use of the pronouns\nyou\nand\nhe\nin order to distinguish                between two different degrees of alienation:\nyou\nstands                for the exiled author\nhere\nand\nnow,\nhe\nis the                author\nthere\nand\nthen,\nin the China of the Cultural                Revolution. The framing chapters, which describe episodes in the                author’s exiled existence, are as factual and personally revealing                as those dealing with his different roles during the Cultural Revolution.                It is these framing chapters that enable the author to give his                view on the meaning of human existence, the nature of literature,                the conditions of authorship and, first and foremost, on the importance                of remembering and of imagination for the author’s view of reality.\nThe foundation for Gao Xingjian’s pioneering activity as a dramatist                  was laid in the first half of the nineteen-eighties when he worked                  as artistic advisor, director of plays and playwright at the People’s                  Art Theatre in Peking, at that time considered to be the country’s                  foremost stage. Gao Xingjian’s plays are characterized by originality,                  in no way diminished by the fact that he has been influenced both                  by modern Western and traditional Chinese currents. His greatness                  as a dramatist lies in the manner in which he has succeeded in                  enriching these fundamentally different elements and making them                  coalesce to something entirely new.\nDear Gao Xingjian: You did not leave China empty-handed. You have                  come to look on the native language which you brought with you                  when you left China as your true and real country. It gives me                  great joy to offer you, on behalf of the Swedish Academy, our                  warmest congratulations. I will ask you now to receive, from the                  hands of His Majesty the King, this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

S. Naipaul\n- V. S. Naipaul\nSwedish Academy,\nDecember 10, 2001.\nTranslation of the Swedish text.\nDr. Horace Engdahl delivering the Presentation Speech for the 2001 Nobel Prize in Literature at the Stockholm Concert Hall.\nPhoto: Hans Mehlin\nYour Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Honoured Nobel Laureates, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIn the Middle Ages, master craftsmen worked in full view in the street or in an open workshop, so that prospective buyers could see that the materials they use were geniune and that no defects were hidden beneath a luxurious surface treatment. Similarly, as a mature writer V. S. Naipaul has allowed us to scrutinize his craft and the conditions surrounding it. He has candidly described how, as a beginner, he neglected to obtain knowledge of what he saw and falsified his experiences in order to live up to the perception of literature he had gained through his British schooling.\nHe knew at an early age that he had to write, but not what. His first book,\nThe Mystic Masseur,\nappears very bold when read in the light of his confessions about the awkward beginnings of his own career as a writer. The masseur/charlatan is the author’s shadow and caricature, to which he exorcistically transfers his bizarre traits and imagined failures, something like\nSartre\ndid with the autodidact in\nLa Nausée.\nNaipaul was born on the West Indian island of Trinidad as a descendant of immigrant workers from India, in a milieu where peoples and cultures from four continents mixed. In his case, moving into literature presupposed irrevocably breaking away from these origins. Yet it was not until the moment when he decided to explore what he had abandoned that his writing took off. His childhood street set the tone for him. At first it was playful and immediate, but the subject grew in his hands. In the book that made him famous,\nA House for Mr. Biswas,\nhe lent the profundity of the major novel to the wing-clipped characters in a Caribbean backwater and granted them dignity. Mr. Biswas, who bears traits of Naipaul’s father, gained a place in the English literary gallery of immortal tragicomic heroes.\nNaipaul’s subsequent works examined, in ever wider circles, the forgotten historical circumstances that explain the author’s background. He became an explorer, not of the wilderness but of societies – everywhere at home and a stranger, a Ulysses whose only Ithaca was his desk. Perhaps he is a witness from the freely circulating humanity of the future.\nNaipaul has been praised for writing the best English in the market, and that may well be, but his view of style is reminiscent of Stendahl’s, who believed a writer has failed if the reader remembers the words he has written: what should remain are his ideas. Naipaul is no worshipper of fantasy or utopia, no creator of alternative worlds. Dickens’ ability to describe London with the open gaze and simplicity of a child is his declared ideal. He continues a critical direction in literature that distances itself from myth and expressive hyperbole. His text is permanently unrelenting, like a chill wind that will not stop blowing.\nIn\nReading and Writing,\nan essay of great value in understanding his works, Naipaul relates his steadily growing doubts about the novel, the grand genre of the West. He describes how while working on his history of Trinidad,\nThe Loss of El Dorado,\nhe found in the archives traces of the native tribe that had given its name to the small city where he spent his first years, and how his perception of reality suddenly expanded. “Fiction by itself would not have taken me to this larger comprehension,” he writes. The technique he adopted while working on\nEl Dorado\n– unearthing from the documents the life stories of seemingly insignificant individuals – returns when he works with the notes from his journeys. The various literary forms he has tried – fictional narrative, autobiography, feature story and historical documentary – have eventually merged into a unique genre, “prose in the style of Naipaul”. By this innovation, he has enlarged the territory of literature.\nOne experience that seems to have been crucial to his literary method is his first encounter with India. He saw traces of a history that had been concealed from view when the champions of independence had to deny the misfortunes that had preceded the English: six hundred years of Muslim imperialism that deliberately destroyed the memory of earlier civilisations and plunged the Hindus into a helplessness similar to that of the American Indians. He studied R.K. Narayan’s novels in the Indian setting and saw that their world is built around an emptiness that the author is incapable of dealing with: the forgotten defeat that turned people into dwarves among monumental ruins. Only an intact culture provides the background knowledge that makes the novel a reasonable form, Naipaul argues. He found that he had to cling to the authenticity of details and voices and abstain from fabulation, while continuing to give his material a literary shape. He became a collector of testimony.\nThis method presupposes the courage to seek out human phenomena that frighten every normal observer, the author included. But even when he reports from places where no hope seems to exist, the author’s empathy makes itself felt in the acuity of his ear. He says he finds every person interesting, at least for the first few hours. He distinguishes individual fates beyond the dutiful idealization that controls our perception of the earth’s ill-fated nations. He wants to understand the principle of every person’s life, the decisive thing that makes him what he is. He records the relationship between pretension and reality, two contours that never really cover each other and never completely diverge.\nDecay and disappearance are a fundamental theme in Naipaul’s writings – but without grief, rather as something that makes existence bearable. The English landscape that he discovers in\nThe Enigma of Arrival\nis the ruin of an age of greatness, and at last he feels at home! He says that even as a child, he has pondered that he was born into a world past its climax. Yet his books are not negative. His phrasing embodies an absence of resignation that keeps melancholy at bay and shares with the reader the pure joy of intelligence.\nNaipaul has praised the West for having recognized the right to individual endeavour and for its diffidence. The core of his devotion to European civilisation is that it was the only one of the alternative cultures that made it possible for him to become a writer.\nSir Vidia!\nYour life as a writer calls to mind what Alfred Nobel said of himself: “My homeland is where I work, and I work everywhere.” In every place, you have remained yourself, faithful to your instinct. Your books trace the outline of an individual quest of unusual dimensions. Like a Nemo piloting a craft of your own design, without representing anyone or anything, you have manifested the independence of literature.

The bestial, systematic evil of Nazism and the   bureaucratic, misanthropic stupidity of the socialistic one-party   state are hardly comprehensible to minds that have been shaped in   civilized societies: nor do they allow themselves to be portrayed   in other ways than as crazy paradoxes and absurdities.\nImre Kertész has written about this artistic problem in his\nGalley Diary\nand in his essay collection\nEine   Gedankenlänge Stille.\nIt has often been argued that\nFateless\nis the hub and   center of Kertész’s literary production. That may be   correct: this ostensibly simple, naked and mundanely unassuming   account of a young boy’s life and sufferings in Auschwitz, Zeitz   and Buchenwald possesses a weightiness and irrefutability that   puts it not only at the core of one man’s literary production but   also of contemporary European prose.\n“When you are going to read Kertész, you have to begin with\nFateless\n!” is a very common statement. However, it can   be called into question.\nNo matter which Kertész novel or essay we pick up, we soon   notice that it is intimately connected to one of the other works   in his literary production. In a manner that is hard to explain,   the separate parts appear to have grown together, with common   root fibers or circulatory systems.\nFiasco,\nthat   many-voiced, off-center account of a system-critical writer’s   desperate hardships in a totalitarian, anti-educational state, is   linked by allusions and thematic details with\nThe English   Flag,\nwhich in turn is intimately connected to the much   later book of thoughts\nGalley Diary.\nFrom\nKaddish   for a Child Not Born,\na mournful and simultaneously ironic   requiem for a child who is never allowed to be born, because it   would be cruel and criminal to bring it into the world, there are   delicate but easily discernible threads that link it to\nFateless\nand\nFiasco.\nWhat finally reveals itself to the reader is a coherent organism,   a body or symphonic work in the spirit of Mahler or Webern. Or in   a word that borrows its solemn tone from the aging\nThomas Mann\n: Ein   WERK. An oeuvre, whose subject is an individual’s refusal to   abandon his individual will by merging it with a collective   identity.\nAnd behind each text, we clearly hear a voice or tone that   Kertész himself has formulated this way: In all respects my   existence is horrible, except for writing: so I write and write   to endure my existence, to justify it.\nKertész approaches tradition in a similar contrapuntal way.   In his world, tradition is not a temporal phenomenal, but a   spatial one. Tradition is his surroundings, the landscape where   he resides and where on his rambles he encounters social   companions and conversational companions like\nCamus\n, Nietzsche,   Schopenhauer, St. John of the Cross, Kafka or Paul Celan.\nSehr verehrter Imre Kertesz!\nUns, die wir Ihrer Dichtung begegnet sind und den Vorteil hatten   uns in sie zu vertiefen, scheint sie notwendig und unentbehrlich   um das “20. Jahrhundert, das wir noch unser eigenes nennen   müssen, zu verstehen. Und das um so mehr, um auch das   Schwanken zwischen Schicksal und Freiheit zu begreifen, welches   das Los des preisgegebenen und wehrlosen Menschen während   dieses Jahrhunderts gewesen ist. Es war und ist eine Zeit, die   scheinbar Ihre Hypothese bestätigt, dass der Affe vom   Menschen abstammt und nicht umgekehrt. Hinter diesem Gedanken,   der ein wenig misanthropisch vorkommen mag, hört man   deutlich den milden und klugen Humor, der Ihr ganzes   schriftstellerisches Werk durchströmt.\nSie haben auch einmal geschrieben: Ich werde immer ein   zweitrangiger, verkannter und missverstandener ungarischer   Schriftsteller sein; die ungarische Sprache wird immer eine   zweitrangige, verkannte und missverstandene Sprache sein.\nGegen diese ironische Behauptung möchte die Schwedische   Akademie am kräftigsten protestieren und Ihnen gleichzeitig   herzlich gratulieren, wenn ich Sie jetzt auffordere, den   Nobelpreis für Literatur aus der Hand Seiner Majestät   des Königs entgegenzunehmen.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

M. Coetzee\n- J. M. Coetzee\nSwedish   Academy\n, December 10, 2003.\nTranslation of the Swedish text.\nWriter Per Wästberg delivering the       Presentation Speech for the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature at       the Stockholm Concert Hall.\nPhoto: Hans Mehlin\nYour Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Esteemed                  Nobel Laureates, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nTo write is to awaken counter-voices within   oneself, and to dare enter into dialogue with them. The dangerous   attraction of the inner self is John Coetzee’s theme: the senses   and bodies of people, the interiority of Africa. “To imagine the   unimaginable” is the writer’s duty. As a post-modern allegorist,   Coetzee knows that novels that do not seek to mimic reality best   convince us that reality exists.\nCoetzee sees through the obscene poses and   false pomp of history, lending voice to the silenced and the   despised. Restrained but stubborn, he defends the ethical value   of poetry, literature and imagination. Without them, we blinker   ourselves and become bureaucrats of the soul.\nJohn Coetzee’s characters seek refuge   beyond the zones of power.\nLife and Times of Michael K.\ngives form to the dream of an individual outside the fabric of   human coexistence. Michael K. is a virgin being, viewing the   world from an infinite remove. Although exposed to the violence   of racist tyranny, he achieves through passivity a freedom that   confounds both the apartheid regime and the guerrilla forces   simply because he wants nothing: neither war nor revolution,   neither power nor money.\nWaiting for the Barbarians\nis a   disturbing love story about wanting to possess another person and   to turn that person inside out as though she were a riddle to be   solved. Everyone who has recognised the threat of totalitarianism   and felt the desire to own another person can learn from   Coetzee’s dark fables. With intense concreteness and verbally   disciplined desperation, he tackles one of the great problems of   the ages: understanding the driving forces of brutality, torture   and injustice.\nWho does the writing, who seizes power by   taking pen in hand? Can black experience be depicted by a white   person? In\nFoe\n, Friday is an African, already   dehumanised by Defoe. To give speech to Friday would be to   colonise him and deny him what remains of his integrity. The girl   in\nWaiting for the Barbarians\nspeaks an unintelligible   language and has been blinded by torture; Michael K has a harelip   and Friday has had his tongue cut out. His life is recounted by   Susan Barton: that is, through ‘white writing’, the title of one   of Coetzee’s books.\nHowever hard we attempt to grasp Michael   and Friday, they have been made, by Coetzee, unsullied by   interpretation. They remain silent. But between the lines, in   what is unspoken, there is a distillation of feelings uncommon in   contemporary literature.\nThe myth of the survivor on a desert island   is the only story there is, Coetzee once said. Several of his   books treat similar solitudes. Is it possible to stand outside   history? Does freedom from the diktat of authority exist? “I   don’t like accomplices. God, let me be alone,” says Jacobus   Coetzee in the first novel,\nDusklands\n, rejoicing in   being abandoned. But he remains the tool of history, and what   compels the natives to take him seriously is his victorious   violence. He does, however, ask himself whether the blacks   populate a wonderful world closed to his own senses: “Perhaps I   have killed something of inestimable value.”\nCoetzee’s work runs like a high-tension   cable across an inhospitable South African landscape. Mrs. Curran   in A\nge of Iron\nhas witnessed monstrous actions but is   unable to condemn them using the words of others. Neither will   Coetzee himself sign petitions or join in political rallies.\nIn the dystopian novel\nDisgrace\n,   David Lurie does not achieve creativity and freedom until,   stripped of all dignity, he is afflicted by his own shame and   history’s disgrace. In this work, Coetzee summarises his themes:   race and gender, ownership and violence, and the moral and   political complicity of everyone in that borderland where the   languages of liberation and reconciliation carry no meaning.\nEvery new book by Coetzee is astonishingly   unlike his others. He intrudes into the uninhabited spaces of his   readers. In his autobiographies, he pitilessly ransacks his   former selves. In his essay-novel Elizabeth Costello he combines,   with uninhibited humour and irony, contemporary narrative and   myth, philosophy and gossip.\nDear John Coetzee,\nYour work is limited in pages, limitless in   scope. What I have said in Swedish to those present here is   merely in so many words: “Don’t listen to me, just go home and   read, and some images will stay with you forever.”\nIn your own life, you have recently moved   along the very latitude that unites Cape Town and Adelaide. You   may have left South Africa; it will hardly leave you.

Unsettling and surprising us, you have dug   deeply into the ground of the human condition with its cruelty   and loneliness. You have given a voice to those outside the   hierarchies of the mighty. With intellectual honesty and density   of feeling, in a prose of icy precision, you have unveiled the   masks of our civilization and uncovered the topography of   evil.\nI would like to express the warmest   congratulations of the Swedish Academy as I now request you to   receive this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature from the hands of   His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The author is everywhere and nowhere, never quite standing behind   her words, nor ever ceding to her literary figures in order to   allow the illusion that they should exist outside her language.   There is nothing but a stream of saturated sentences, seemingly   welded together under high pressure and leaving no room for moments   of relaxation.\nElfriede Jelinek deliberately opens her work   to the clichés that flood the news media, advertising and   popular culture — the collective subconscious of our time.   She manipulates the codes of pulp literature, comics, soap operas,   pornography and folkloristic novels (\nHeimatsroman\n), so that the   inherent madness in these ostensibly harmless consumer phenomena   shines through. She mimics the prejudices we would never admit   to, and captures, hidden behind common sense, a poisonous mumble   of no origin or address: the voice of the masses. She has said   that she taps at language to hear its hidden ideologies, much as   a doctor will tap on a patient’s chest. Aghast, we discover   how class oppression, sexism, chauvinism and the distortion of   history echo through everyday conversation. Sport is immediately   suspect: its militaristic drills, the uniforms, the cult of the   strong and the victorious. Nature: a political trap. Austria’s   alpine landscape has been the perfect backdrop for her destruction   of the idyllic.\nWhen our normal ideals and daydreams are rendered   with Elfriede Jelinek’s instrumentation of heartless word-plays,   macabre metaphors and infernally twisted quotations from the classics,   they are never again the same. Her insinuating tone, like infrared   light elucidates the hidden writing of civilisation. Where we saw   normal society, we now see a locked-down system of male/female,   assault and submission, hunter and prey. Indeed, we are forced   to accept that we find the hunter’s language sexier than   the prey’s. Elfriede Jelinek’s social criticism is   formed not from the safe distance of superior knowledge but from   the depths of an unqualified contamination. In her works, the dead   return not to comfort but to bear witness. Ghosts are as ubiquitous   as the living, and there is no clear distinction between them.   The woman’s being is like the vampire’s, at once alive   and dead, since her full expression is forbidden. Some of Elfriede   Jelinek’s heroines seem to have stepped out of male fantasies   of blood-sucking she-monsters from the turn of the 20th century.   As heir to a long line of linguistically critical Austrian writers,   from Johann Nepomuk Nestroy to Ingeborg Bachmann and Thomas Bernhard,   she also knows the importance of deflating the pathos of disaster.   Her parade of luckless princesses from fairytales and real life   in the drama suite\nDer Tod und das Mädchen\nis condensed   into the picture of Marilyn Monroe’s blonde hair billowing out   from under the lid when they close the coffin at her funeral. Swiftly   comes the deprecating simile: “like foam seeping from a fire   extinguisher”.\nLiterary genres pale to disappearance under   Jelinek’s hand. Her plays are not theatre, rather “texts   to be spoken”, liberated from the tyranny of dramatical roles.   Astonished directors find she has delivered into their hands material   to revolutionise theatre.\nHer novels — the sweet girls as losers   in\nWomen as Lovers\n, the murderous logic of youth revolt in\nWonderful,   Wonderful Times\n, the aesthetic of self-mutilation in\nThe   Pianist\n,   the endless repetition of the simple fact of penetration in\nLust\n,   the ABC of the violation of women in\nGier\n— cheerfully break   the laws of classic narrative art. The author does not cede the   floor, observing her characters almost as insects under a glass   cover. Her phrasing is itself the action. Through the musical interchange   of voices and counter-voices, a world comes into being, illuminated   by her life-giving fury.\nWhat is a hero in a literary work? Other differences   aside, it is\nsomeone who is right when the world is wrong\n. In male   modernism, it has often been the author himself, disguised as the   solitary voice of the outcast ego. This invites empathy and identification,   thereby producing literature’s eternal karaoke-effect, where   the reader joins in on the chorus. The difficulty in reading Elfriede   Jelinek is that there is no sympathetic narrator in whom the reader   can rest and with whom the reader can identify. It is an awakening   from the narcissism of reading.\nHer writings perhaps give us a dark picture   of life, but she is no pessimist, since in pessimism there is generally   a whiff of self-pity and a tacit plea. Rather, grinding through   her imprecations is a scandalous joviality without hope, rays from   a black sun.\nMost honoured Elfriede Jelinek!\nIn the words of Hegel, woman is society’s irony. Through your   writing, you have given new currency to an heretical feminine tradition   and have expanded the art of literature. You negotiate with neither   society nor your time, nor do you adapt to your readers. If literature   by definition is a force that bends to nothing, you are in our   day one of its truest representatives.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech. NobelPrize.org.

Like Kafka, Proust and Graham   Greene he has charted a territory, a Pinterland with a distinct   topography.\nWith his twenty-nine plays and about a hundred   that he has directed or acted in, he has made the theatre his own   domain. His figures barricade themselves in unpredictable dialogues.   Between the lines of unresolved threats, it roils and stings. What   we hear are signals for everything we do not hear.\nThe abyss under chat, the unwillingness to   communicate other than superficially, the need to rule and mislead,   the suffocating sensation of accidents bubbling under the quotidian,   the nervous perception that a dangerous story has been censored – all   this vibrates through Pinter’s drama.\nHis characters are at the mercy of each other   on the periphery of life. They are also prisoners in the limbo   of class divisions, set phrases and solidified habits. Their identities,   backgrounds and histories are vague, and different versions exist   depending on who is remembering. They seldom listen to each other   but it is precisely their mental deafness that makes us listen.   Not a word passes unnoticed, nor can we relax a single minute.   Atmospheric pressure fluctuates as secrets unroll and shift the   distribution of power.\nMemories –  invented, manipulated or real –  flow   as a hot undercurrent through Pinter’s plays. We model the   past to respond to the demands of the present and to form our future.\nAs closed rooms open to an international community,   Pinter redefines romantic love as a more resilient love that includes   friendship and the exigency to promote justice through action.   In\nMountain Language\n, love takes the form of an unconditional generosity   missing in his earlier works. To survive, we must do good deeds   and stand up for the enslaved in this age of terror and spiralling   violence.\nIt is usually said that Pinter’s political   commitment came late. But Pinter himself describes even his first   period –\nThe Dumb Waiter\n,\nThe Birthday Party\n,\nThe   Hothouse\n–  as   political. In these “comedies of menace”, language   is a weapon of aggression, evasion and torture. The early works   can be seen as metaphors for authoritarian intervention on several   levels: the power of the state, the power of the family, the power   of religion –  all undermining the individual’s critical   questions. Pinter uncovers the reasons for wanting to destroy the   identity of others and the fear disguised as violence against those   who stand outside the party, club or nation.\nPinter’s work has neither winners nor   losers. In the power game between characters, we seldom know who   has the upper hand; they change places, growing and sinking through   lines that seldom seem deliberate. The characters have sides invisible   to the eye, exposed in the ultraviolet rays of ambiguity. They   grope forward between invisible walls and stratify into different   levels of reality. In defending themselves against intrusion, they   blockade themselves in spaces mined like alien terrain.\nPinter has perforated conventionally realistic   drama with taciturnity’s mystery, and has equipped his overblown   figures with so many outlets that we can live with the characters   and see them age and decay as we do. The solid and impenetrable   figures of public life disintegrate in disastrous incoherence.   They send messages that never seem to arrive, yet we leave the   theatre less righteous than on entering.\nFor systematists, the world exists to put in   order. For Harold Pinter it is for dissembling, through which the   good and the humane find a way to seep out through the bureaucratic   cage of ingrained reflexes. In a ruthless analysis of the totalitarian,   he illuminates the pain of the individual.\nThrowaway lines sting, little words corrode,   what is half-said crushes, what is tacit forebodes catastrophe.   Pinter, the tailor’s son, scissors language, allowing the action to originate from the voices and rhythms of the characters. Thus, there is no given plot. We do not ask: “What will happen next”? Rather, “What   is happening”?\nThe words are instruments of power. Words are   repeated until they resemble truth. In a time of over-information,   Pinter frees words from describing reality and makes them reality   itself, at times poetic, more often oppressive. At the end, it   is only through language that we can erase our destiny and recreate   it.\nDear Harold Pinter,\nIn its choice of a Nobel Laureate the Swedish Academy recognises only the creative power of a single individual regardless of nation, sex and literary genre. This needs emphasising. However British you may appear in the eyes of many, your international and inter-human impact in the field of drama has been uniquely strong and inspiring for half a century. If someone thinks your prize is late in coming, we may reply that at any given moment somewhere in the world your plays are reinterpreted by new generations of directors and actors.\nIn your works, seductively accessible and frighteningly mysterious, the curtain rises on dense life-landscapes and harrowing confinement. In poetic images, you illuminate an existence where fantasy and   the nightmare of reality clash.\nIn the absence of this year’s Nobel Laureate in Literature,   I request his publisher Mr. Stephen Page to come forward and receive   Mr. Pinter’s Prize from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

The artist was German, embodying European   landscape painting techniques and outlook — that combination   of daydreaming and curiosity about the world that we call the picturesque   and that was still alien to Turkish culture. But it was with genuine   Istanbulite knowledge that the painter, after many years working   in the city, saw the palaces, streets, throngs and the play of light   on the Bosphorus waters. He had to be both Easterner — to   understand what he was seeing — and Westerner to have the   method to portray it.\nOrhan Pamuk is describing here his own double view of reality.   When Pamuk uses the Western form for the novel, it sheds its firm   central perspective, tied to the protagonist’s actions and   emotions. Instead, we are drawn into a labyrinth of stories and   beliefs, where the person we identify with can at any moment meet   himself as a stranger, advancing from another direction, from another   life or another culture.\nIn\nMy Name is Red\n, Pamuk uses a sultan’s painters   of miniatures in 1590s Istanbul to stage a conflict between Western   individualism and Eastern traditionalism. As the novel presents   it, the classic Muslim standpoint is that paintings must illustrate   familiar stories. To portray only what the eye sees in nature is   a blasphemy. Ideally, one should paint from memory, painting the   essence of the object and not its appearance, discarding everything   extraneous and elevating oneself to Allah’s view of the world.   To leave traces in the work that can be identified as personal style   was seen by the ancient masters as proof of ineptitude. For them,   Western portraiture expressed a sinful desire to show pride before   God. Anyone who would allow himself to be thus portrayed, believes   himself to be singularly important and positions himself at the   world’s centre, as does the deliberately original artist with   his style. Such a person will no longer bow to authorities but assumes   the right to doubt everything and anything. That unique brushstroke,   when the painter’s hand obeys only his gaze, is a movement   that threatens to topple every holy truth.\nThe choice between alternative views in the novel is seductively   simple for a modern reader, but is revealed to be treacherous. At   the same time as Pamuk, through his way of writing, appears to be   on the side of personal style, he questions whether the unique stroke   actually exists. Do not both love and art imply the imitation of   gestures we have seen in others?\nIn Pamuk’s major work,\nThe Black Book,\ncivilisation   appears as a boundless plagiarism where people flee into each other’s   imagined lives to be free from themselves and experience love. You   become what you describe.\nThe Black Book\nis an odyssey through   a night-time Istanbul full of genies and semi-beings, a city where   invented stories attract more credibility than the true, and truth   is a shadow on the wall. A dream world and a metaphor for the cosmos.   Man’s helpless need for narration has seldom been described   more tellingly. Like Oscar Wilde pointing out that the Thames fog   was imitating Turner’s painting, Pamuk shows that the real   Istanbul exists only because of its fabulists.\nIn his novel\nSnow,\nPamuk travels to a forgotten town on   a remote Turkish border. This displacement, no less drastic than   a journey from Earth to Moon, gives him the opportunity to take   a geological core sample of all levels of Turkish society, from   the loyal state establishment to disappointed leftist intellectuals,   Islamic fundamentalists, Kurds and the mystically suicidal girls   fighting for the right to wear veils. In the centre of the story   stands a Western-influenced poet looking for a way back from exile.\nSnow\nhas   been called a political novel, but more than the expression of an   opinion, it is, like Dostoyevsky’s\nDemons\n, a criticism   of politics and its impact on the human mind. The fanatic’s   conviction stems from a blindness to the motivations of others.   Against this, Pamuk puts the writer’s emphatic identification   with all his figures, beyond good and evil. The inherent irony of   the events is the only judgment that he passes. The novel’s   charismatic fundamentalist, who terrifies the authorities and bewitches   the woman the poet wants to love — on a mystic level, their   struggle is Orpheus’s defeat by Dionysus — this death-defying   terrorist first of all strives to have his threats against Europe   published in one of the big German newspapers so that the West will   pay him notice. In the end,\nSnow\nis a book about the right   to uncertainty and vacillation, about love as a lifelong defeat   and about the longing for God.\nMost honoured Orhan Pamuk! You have made your native city an indispensable   literary territory, equal to Dostoyevsky’s St. Petersburg,   Joyce’s Dublin or Proust’s Paris – a place where   readers from all corners of the world can live another life, just   as credible as their own, filled by an alien feeling that they immediately   recognise as their own.\nI would like to express the warm congratulations of the Swedish   Academy as I now request you to receive this year’s Nobel   Prize for Literature from the hand of His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

She has contributed to changing the way we see the world. In all probability, no other Laureates has accumulated such a volume of work. We stroll through the great library of her work, where all sections are unmarked and all genre classification pointless. There is life and movement behind the broad or narrow spines of the books, resisting categorisation and the imposition of order.\nLessing links to the great narrative tradition of the 19\nth\ncentury but equally we may use her works as textbooks in 20\nth\n-century behavioural patterns, not least to discover the way many thought – or thought wrongly – during one of history’s most turbulent periods as war succeeded war, colonialism was unmasked and communism in Europe conquered.\nShe has revealed the totalitarian temptations and shown us the strength of undogmatic humanism. She has displayed an almost limitless empathy with odd lives and a freedom from prejudice regarding every form of human behaviour. She was early in flagging global environmental threats and poverty and corruption in the Third World. She has given voice to the silent and to the refugees and homeless of our century – from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. And as few others have done, she personified the woman’s role in the 20\nth\ncentury.\nShe makes us exclaim: “How could she know?” since she was often first to speak about what no one else did. For her, nothing was too unimportant or insignificant. Which is why she batters at our hearts. But although she resembles a continent that initially defies exploration, she has never subscribed to the idea that the world is too complicated for clarification.\nUndeterred, she peers under mossy stones and mouldy linoleum flooring, shying from nothing, and therefore becoming help and support for innumerable people. Like Frances in\nThe Sweetest Dream\n, she takes care of everyone, a hospitable earth mother – later compiling perspicacious case studies of her visitors.\nDoris Lessing writes as she breathes – to approach closer the trials and revelations of our existence. Eschewing protective gloves, she grasps our reality like a grubby root vegetable, uncovering experiences we did not realise we could access. Via thousands of intimate details and in lower-case letters – dare we call them feminine? – she phrases the eternal questions of how and why we live.\nHer autobiographical novels were succeeded by memoirs from Rhodesia and London:\nUnder My Skin\nand\nWalking in the Shade\n. They vibrate with sensuous life and manage unusually sharp focus in a telescopic rearview mirror, pitilessly probing social critique and a fearless ability to look inward. Lessing struggles with her parents, especially her mother, up to an advanced age, providing us with merciless images of motherhood. From the beginning, ideas, movements and feelings were swirling through the girl, making her a relentless witness of her time, and an authority-antagonist for whom the emperor is always naked.\nWalking in the Shade\nends in 1962 when\nThe Golden Notebook\nbecame an epiphany for an entire generation of women. In this, Lessing’s most experimental novel, battle is joined between the will to create and the desire to love. Obstacles are mapped for a woman seeking both independence and intimacy, since her freedom is paradoxically incomplete without the love that in turn undermines it. Lessing shows how conventions and other pitfalls along the way impede sensitive and passionate women from living authentically and fully, from glimpsing into the fifth, golden notebook.\nEmotions blind and lead astray Lessing’s heroines and endanger their free will.\nChildren of Violence\nis the collective name for the five books about Martha Quest, Lessing’s alter ego, who, in moving from a colonial existence to the British class hierarchy, is swept away by her dreams and primary instincts.\nChiefly female readers identified with Martha Quest’s longing for freedom and disgust at hypocrisy and mendacity. A poor person in a rich society, a woman among men, a white among blacks, Doris Lessing worked to become the independent intellectual she was. She unveils the temptation of devotion to a utopia and absorption in a collective, and she illustrates how a triumphant ideology can deceive us with false redemption. She became a cartographer of disillusionment, drawing dystopias and catastrophes with frightening clarity.\nLessing has the ability to freely move into and away from herself, to barge in and become an invisible lodger. She often begins by observing her characters from within and then moving outside them, to strip them of their illusions from an objective distance. We can follow this eerie process in\nThe Summer before the Dark\n; in the allegorical psycho-thriller about a monster child,\nThe Fifth Child\n; and in\nThe Good Terrorist\n, an in-depth account of the extreme leftwing squatting culture that sponges off female self-sacrifice.\nIn her later works, Lessing demolishes a long list of basic values. Left are the networks of family and friends, cats of course, and the foremothers and midwives in every sense who take responsibility, and always too much responsibility. And in this year’s novel,\nThe Cleft\n, she accords us a parable from the dawn of mankind – before the invention of love. Which is where she seems happiest, among hunters and gatherers, far from a contemporary culture that presages disorder and collapse.\nDoris Lessing’s epic landscapes shift from honest realism to symbolic fable, from the psychology of self-realisation to saga and myth. Using the lens of intuition, she has charted the changes from the decline of the empire through to a future earth ravaged by atomic warfare. Mara and Dann in the eco-fable of the same name flee from a new Ice Age to an uncertain foothold in what used to be Africa. In her massive\nCanopus in Argos\nsuite she lets observers from another solar system report on our civilisation’s ultimate phase. She moves freely across the plains of fantasy without raising her voice; she declines the rhetoric of doomsday preachers.\nEver since her African debut in 1950 with the tragic novel\nThe Grass Is Singing\n, Lessing has disregarded boundaries: moral, gender or of habit. Solitude and social ostracism remain her thematic glue.\nBut when she occasionally draws a parallel between love and politics, it is because both stand for the hope we must try to sustain if living is to be worthwhile.\nDear Doris Lessing,\nAge is no issue in literature. You are forever young and wise, old and rebellious. You are the least ingratiating of novelists. Your bout with destiny and reality is heavyweight-class; nothing has induced you to leave the ring. Throughout the world over the last 58 years, people have been warmed, provoked and led hand-in-hand by your books. You have helped us cope with some of our time’s important concerns and you have created a document for the future to carry forward the flavour of an age, its prejudices and survival strategies, its everyday trifles and delights.\nYour lifework and your great pioneering effort are today not fulfilled but crowned with a prize you have long deserved.

Roland Barthes maintained that the most antiquated of all literary conventions was the proper name – the Peter, Paul, and Anna who never existed but whom we are expected to take seriously and feel concerned about when we read novels. His view was in accordance with\nle nouveau roman\n, the new French novel, which at the time, forty years ago, was doing away with psychologically shaped characters, turning them into angles of vision, camera lenses.\nIn such a climate, Jean-Marie Le Clézio set out on his literary path. He writes in his second book,\nLa fièvre\n(1965;\nFever\n, 1966): “Poems, short stories and novels are antiquities that no longer fool anyone or just about. […] All that is left is the writing, writing that gropes its way along with words that searches and describes, meticulously and in depth that clings on to and ruthlessly works over reality.” The young Le Clézio was not alone in wanting to shake off the genres. But while his colleagues stressed doubt in the apprehensibility of reality, he chose to believe in the alliance of language with matter and the body.\nHis first novel,\nLe procès-verbal\n(\nThe Interrogation\n), which made him a celebrity at the age of twenty-three, mixes confessions, parodies, diary fragments, found texts, newspaper items, word play, and dialogues from a mental hospital. In its feverish prose speaks a generation that has lost its faith in hierarchies. Everything that language captures seems equally valuable and equally instable. Le Clézio’s early books are a verbal “big bang” with figures that appear and disappear, sudden bursts of light, vast silences, glowing matter, a universe in the making that continually dissolves its forms.\nHe could have stayed with prose poetry and crisis writing, heir of Lautréamont and Michaux and Stig Dagerman, if it had not been for his travels. A several year long stay in Central  America brought him into contact with Indian culture, and this changed the conditions of his literary production. He discovered the denied knowledge that did not suit modernity and that progress had put in the shadows. He discovered that he was actually an Indian, but a poor one. In time, he would find a connection between this experience and his own family’s history, his ancestors’ migration to Mauritius, the struggle and the freedom at the ocean’s edge. That cleared the way for masterpieces such as\nRévolutions\nand\nL’Africain\n.\nThis year’s Laureate in Literature belongs to the tradition of the critique of civilisation, which on French ground can be traced back to Chateaubriand, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Diderot, and yes, Montaigne. In the nineteen hundreds, it was represented with furious enthusiasm by Artaud, who Le Clézio follows in his relations with the old Mexican gods.\nHis books give a place of honour to eccentrics who have preserved the ties with their origin: gypsies, fishermen, ox drivers, nomads. He prefers groups in constant motion, those who live in our societies without belonging to them, and saves them from banality. Few authors have so convincingly described how reluctantly languages and cultures die. This is one of our time’s unexpected experiences, which inspires hope and anguish in equal measure. The imprint of history does not fade. We do not become more like one another. The universally human is, for Le Clézio, the opposite of the international service type without a past encouraged in the Western capitals.\nIn the novel\nDésert\n(1980), which marked a new turn in his writing, the outsider position is represented by a Bedouin girl, who has left North Africa to look for work in France. She is an image of humanity before the Fall that came with the use of money. Unlearned, she reads the language of things with unerring certainty. An inborn remote gaze that defies time and place puts her in contact with her people’s great past. Europe is seen in this novel through the eyes of the unwanted immigrants and appears as a realm of death.\nThe open form of this book has become typical for its author, a form that juxtaposes separate places, times, and discourses without mediation. In his hands, the novel merges with the travel story, the analytical essay, the prose of recollection, and witness literature. This alloy is strong enough to carry a consciousness that is open to global reality and does not merely pretend to be so in order to dominate it. Le Clézio gives us a French that has stepped down from the pedestal of purism and that is permeated by the consciousness of other languages.\nAnd the proper names, the characters? In a very personal essay on cinema published just this year, Le Clézio describes how Jean Vigo expanded the language of film by shifting the focus from individuals to that which they see and experience. In the same way, fictive figures seem to find mercy in Le Clézio’s writing when they appear, not so that we can immerse ourselves in their petty plots, but rather so that we can see with their eyes.\nLe Clézio’s imagination sustains itself in the unexplored regions where fear and ecstasy arise, inseparable from one another. It may seem surprising to call him a hopeful author, given the significant strain of colonial devastation, bourgeois oppressiveness, and social injustice in his themes. Still, he deserves such a designation. The earth’s lustre, the sun, the sea, and the vast expanses, the irrepressible feeling of freedom that comes with a new departure – these are the forces that outweigh the sorrow about the path that our civilisation has taken.\nMost honoured Laureate, dear Jean-Marie Le Clézio!\nYour work is a story of migration; you are yourself a nomad of the world. You have in writing found a gateway to adventure, not as escapism, but as a hunger for the unknown. You have, after a long era in which the highest forms of expression seemed reserved for dystopian experience, restored to literature its power to celebrate the world. I would like to express the warm congratulations of the Swedish Academy as I now ask you to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature from the hand of His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Other literature captures the reader immediately by its resolute address. Herta Müller’s work belongs in the latter category. Her prose has a linguistic energy that we bond with from the first sentence. Something concerning life or death is at stake. We sense this quickly through the temperature, the hurried breathing, the sharp detail, and everything implied but left unsaid.\nThis energy springs from a refusal to accept what is. Herta Müller chooses opposition as method, making common cause with the Austrian author, Thomas Bernhard. But, even more strongly than Bernhard’s, her work is anchored in her own experience. She has said that her subjects have chosen her, not the other way around. Almost everything she writes is about life under Ceauşescu’s Romanian dictatorship, its fear and betrayal and constant surveillance.\nBut Herta Müller has also portrayed a kind of dictatorship within a dictatorship: the small, German-speaking rural society in western Romania where she grew up. We enter it in her first book\nNiederungen\n, 1983 (\nNadirs\n, 1999) a suite as cruel as luminous images to a child’s gaping senses. Out steps an alien ego, its alienation also self-induced through a transformative, critical gaze. In the visionary short prose of\nBarfüssiger Februar\nfrom 1987, a dream image such as the black axis deep down at the bottom of the well captures, with hallucinatory strength, the way a village existence orbits life and death.\nQuickly, the exposition of alienation widens into the Romanian dictatorship in general. This happens especially after Herta Müller is forced into exile in Germany in 1987 after years of censorship, interrogation and harassment. It can be said that in her case, exile serves to sharpen the confrontation with dictatorship. This occurs in novels such as:\nDer Fuchs war damals schon der Jäger\nfrom 1992, with its shining series of images of everyday terror;\nHerztier\n, 1994 (\nThe Land of Green Plums\n, 1996) a masterful account of the flight of a group of youths from the terror regime; or\nHeute wär ich mir lieber nicht begegnet,\n1997 (\nThe Appointment\n, 2001) a fractured, chilling thriller in the shadow of imminent interrogation.\nHerta Müller’s experience of oppression leaves her no peace. But central to her art are figures of opposition. In a famous essay, Claudio Guillén coined the word ‘counter-exile’ for writers not defeated by exile through nostalgia. For Herta Müller, doubly rootless, return is an impossibility. The nostalgia is unconscious, flickering through only in the shape of a lone apricot tree on an embankment, so foreign in Berlin’s northern latitudes. As so often, objects show Herta Müller a direction. They play a major part in her prose, because their shadow-side points to the labyrinths of fear.\nHerta Müller has said that her German-speaking upbringing in Romania has been a great inspiration to her writing. For a writer it can be invaluable to have two different languages, and from this situation she early learned to compare, to turn and twist words to extract new meanings.\nYou find, in Herta Müller’s prose, no epic line, no plot with beginning and end. If the world is ambiguous and opaque, literature must cease to provide a deceptive overview of it. She has said that only fictional surprise allows us to approach reality. She scissors out bits of experience to subsequently amalgamate them, and she has also used collage as a method to write poetry. In her essay collection,\nDer König verneigt sich und tötet\nfrom 2003, an indispensable guideline to her authorship, she explains that she finds no conclusive difference between poetry and prose. Her individuality as a narrator resides in just that ability to marry poetry’s density with the feel for detail in prose. She does this in crystal-clear syntax, where every clause demands our attention.\nWith infinite empathy and unsentimental eye, she prolongs her counter-exile in her great novel\nAtemschaukel\nfrom 2009, about the deportation of Romanian-Germans from the year 1945 and their forced labour in what was then the Soviet  Union. Here, she is pursuing the project planned with her close friend, the poet Oskar Pastior, who died in 2006. When young, Pastior had been in a Soviet camp. Even here, in stronger dependency than earlier on documentary material, she succeeds in uniting the lucidity of prose with the shock impact of poetic imagery. In the vivid coinage of the title,\nAtemschaukel\n, translatable as “Breathswing”, she is heir to the great Romanian-German exile poet Paul Celan, who could call one of his collections\nAtemwende\n, “Breathturn”. In intensive, intermittent episodes from camp life, she gives a segment of unavoidable contemporary history renewed visibility.\nLiebe Herta Müller.\nSie haben den großen Mut gehabt, der provinziellen Unterdrückung und dem politischen Terror kompromißlos Widerstandzu leisten. Für den künstlerischen Gehalt dieses Widerstands verdienen Sie diesen Preis. Ihr Werk ist ein Kampf, der weitergeht und weitergehen muß, eine Form des unwiderruflichen Gegen-Exils.

Andersson\nYour Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, esteemed Laureates, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMario Vargas Llosa’s writing has shaped our image of South America and has its own chapter in the history of contemporary literature. In his early years, he was a renewer of the novel; today, an epic poet of not only Latin American stature. His wide embrace enfolds all literary genres.\nHe is hard to classify. From the provincial city of Arequipa in Peru emerged: a citizen of the world, a Marxist transformed by Castro’s misdeeds into a liberal, a losing presidential candidate later to appear on his country’s postage stamps, an epic poet and historian,  a satirist, an eroticist, an essayist and columnist addressing most issues – including football and fear of flying. As a reporter from the world’s flashpoints, he recalls Graham Greene.\nVargas Llosa has led us through unfamiliar milieux with an authority that lends the authenticity of a 19th-century explorer. He links the narrative tradition of Balzac and Tolstoy to the modernistic experiments of\nWilliam Faulkner\n.\nRebellion against an authoritarian father sparked an opposition against circumstance that extended into a youthful escape to literature and imagination. The rebel remains his protagonist – also in the forms of Flora Tristan and her grandson Paul Gauguin, fighting the conventions of their times, or the Irishman Roger Casement who, in a new novel by Vargas Llosa, exposes slavery in the Congo of Leopold II.\nNota bene\n, revolt is successful only as narrative; as long as tyrannical fathers exist in our lives and societies, revolt remains permanent.\nVargas Llosa uses fiction to penetrate the shrouds of power and explore the obsessions of its exploiters. The halls of boarding schools and the corridors of administrations stand against indomitable open-air inhabitants, though the latter seldom triumph in defying regulation and imposition. History crushes Vargas Llosa’s figures but not their consciences.\nIn Latin America, writers are charged with the moral duty of not collaborating in injustice. But the demand for commitment can cripple desire and imagination. Vargas Llosa’s novels never bow to diktat; they are polyphonic and open to interpretation, emphasising the diversity of Latin America’s social and ethnic patterns. He lends voice to the silenced and oppressed – an aesthetic feat and an ethical act. He has an unreserved interest in people – from presidents to prostitutes – and nothing is alien to him, from the arrogance of statesmen to love’s subtlest plots.\nIn his dark picaresque,\nThe War of the End of the World\n, Vargas Llosa is fascinated by fanatics and their world vision. A prophet foresees the end of the world in 1900 and assembles an army of shabby misfits that frustrates Brazil’s military forces. Another fanatic, Mayta in\nThe Real Life of Alejandro Mayta\n, is an Indian quadroon in an underground leftwing sect, first idealist, then terrorist in a Peru on the brink of disintegration. It is a confrontation with youthful revolutionary romanticism. And it is to the mire of social and political chasms that Vargas Llosa has led us, with serene linguistic agility, ever since his early novels,\nThe Time of the Hero\nand\nThe Green House\n.\nVargas Llosa’s late novel about the abuse of power,\nThe Feast of the Goat\n, depicts the Dominican Republic’s tyrant, Trujillo. Servility and despotism are portrayed with brutal intensity, the horrors balanced by compassion and humanity. Among the bizarre detail is the revelation that the dictator coerced the country’s poets into petitioning the Swedish Academy to award his scarcely learned wife the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nVargas Llosa has an eye for the foolishness of innocence and the lethargy of evil. He is unusual in his ability to depict men’s friendship as well as sadistic penalism and hierarchical vanity. He prefers the compromises of common sense to radical utopias. In his book about Flaubert, Vargas Llosa disarmingly claims that he and Emma Bovary have in common “our taste for pleasures of the flesh rather than of the soul, our respect for senses and instincts, our preference for this earthly life above all else”.\nHe writes of love and its absence,  of the seduction of violence and the rare triumph of justice. In his erotic entertainments he is a playful ruffian unafraid of self-mockery. Or, as he expressed it: “There is no great art without a measure of folly, since great art expresses the entirety of human experience, where intuition, obsession, madness and fantasy play their part just as ideas do.”\nVargas Llosa believes in the force of literature. Without literature there would be no rendition of mankind’s possibilities and hidden places. It is a bulwark against prejudice, racism and intolerant nationalism, since in all great literature, men and women of the entire world are equally alive. It is harder to suppress a people that reads a lot.\nSo he has fought for freedom of expression and for human rights regardless of geography, and has done so with a passion for liberty and with political courage and common sense – these not always in harmony in important writers. In a time of tiresome narcissism he is what Zola,\nAndré Gide\nand\nCamus\nembodied: an example and a bellwether.\nMy dear Mario Vargas Llosa; you have encapsulated 20th-century history in a bubble of imagination. It has floated on air for 50 years and shines still. The Swedish Academy congratulates you. Please step forward to receive this year’s Nobel Prize in Literature from the hand of His Majesty the King.\nEstimado Mario Vargas Llosa!

He has been translated into some sixty languages, and has been important to poetry in various parts of the world. The Nobel Laureate\nJoseph Brodsky\nadmits that he stole more than one metaphor from him. And during a journey among Chinese poets a year ago I found that Tranströmer is their great model.\nWhy? Is it the brilliant metaphors? I think that is only half the truth. The other half is the visions, the illuminations in everyday life into which the metaphors have been inserted.\nLet us consider “Carillon” – “chimes” – where we find the poet in a shabby hotel in Bruges, lying on the bed with his arms stretched out, “an anchor that has dug itself down and holds steady / the huge shadow floating up there / the great unknown”. Or think of the picture of defencelessness in the line, “I have low beaches, if death rises six inches I shall be flooded.” What is important is not such separate images but the overall vision where they form a part. The easily flooded poet is the defenceless centre where now different epochs, now far and near converge. Also the anchor chain from the great unknown centres towards this unpretentious subject. But, in this poem, there is an opposite movement as well. The room’s window faces “The Wild Market Square” and the condition of the soul is projected there: “What I carry within me is materialised there, all terrors, all expectations.” There is a movement both inwards and outwards. Once “the sack splits along its seams and the chimes roll out across Flanders”, next time the same bells “bear us home” on their wings. The metaphors lend a sensuous precision to this huge breathing. Remarkably, this complex text is almost weightless, and speaks immediately to our senses.\nThere is a similar huge breathing in\nBaltics\n. The striking images for understanding versus blockage have been integrated into an interplay between “great doors opening and great doors closing”, between one breath of wind “sighing about other shores” and another leaving the place “desolate and silent”.\nBut the movement of Tranströmer’s universe is primarily directed towards the centre. His illuminations gather widespread phenomena in one translucent present. We remember from\nSecrets on the Way\nthe “room that contained every moment – a butterfly museum”.   In tacit polemics against colleagues groping for heaven, he begins his first book of poetry with the words, “Waking up is a parachute jump from dreams.” This is a genuine Tranströmer sinking into the centre, towards an earthly summer.\nIn “Schubertiana”, the precision of this movement towards the centre is caught by the image of the swallows flying for six weeks over two continents “to last year’s nest under the guttering of this very barn in this very parish”. Their flight towards “precisely this vanishing dot in the land-mass” corresponds to the way Schubert “catches the signals from a whole life in a few ordinary chords for five strings”.\nTranströmer’s development has moved towards ever greater openness. His Swedish geography has expanded into the shimmering spiral galaxy of New York and the crowds of Shanghai getting “our silent planet going with their tramping”. And fragments of world politics now and then glitter in the poems. At the same time the picture of unpretentiousness becomes clearer: “I have graduated from the university of oblivion and am as empty-handed as the shirt on the washing-line.” With this relaxed authority, Tranströmer can speak for many of us. Even at an early stage he says, “Each man is a half-open door / leading to a room for everyone.” This is where we are at last – the room that once contained every moment now contains all of us.\nDear Tomas.\nIt is a great pleasure for me to convey to you the warmest congratulations of the Swedish Academy and to ask you to come forward to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Using ridicule and sarcasm Mo Yan attacks history and its falsifications as well as deprivation and political hypocrisy. Playfully and with ill-disguised delight, he reveals the murkiest aspects of human existence, almost inadvertently finding images of strong symbolic weight.\nNorth-eastern Gaomi county embodies China’s folk tales and history. Few real journeys can surpass these to a realm where the clamour of donkeys and pigs drowns out the voices of the people’s commissars and where both love and evil assume supernatural proportions.\nMo Yan’s imagination soars across the entire human existence. He is a wonderful portrayer of nature; he knows virtually all there is to know about hunger, and the brutality of China’s 20th century has probably never been described so nakedly, with heroes, lovers, torturers, bandits – and especially, strong, indomitable mothers. He shows us a world without truth, common sense or compassion, a world where people are reckless, helpless and absurd.\nProof of this misery is the cannibalism that recurs in China’s history. In Mo Yan, it stands for unrestrained consumption, excess, rubbish, carnal pleasures and the indescribable desires that only he can attempt to elucidate beyond all tabooed limitations.\nIn his novel\nRepublic of Wine\n, the most exquisite of delicacies is a roasted three-year-old. Boys have become exclusive foodstuff. The girls, neglected, survive. The irony is directed at China’s family policy, because of which female foetuses are aborted on an astronomic scale: girls aren’t even good enough to eat. Mo Yan has written an entire novel,\nFrog\n, about this.\nMo Yan’s stories have mythical and allegorical pretensions and turn all values on their heads. We never meet that ideal citizen who was a standard feature in Mao’s China. Mo Yan’s characters bubble with vitality and take even the most amoral steps and measures to fulfil their lives and burst the cages they have been confined in by fate and politics.\nInstead of communism’s poster-happy history, Mo Yan describes a past that, with his exaggerations, parodies and derivations from myths and folk tales, is a convincing and scathing revision of fifty years of propaganda.\nIn his most remarkable novel,\nBig Breasts and Wide Hips\n, where a female perspective dominates, Mo Yan describes the Great Leap Forward and the Great Famine of 1960 in stinging detail. He mocks the revolutionary pseudo-science that tried to inseminate sheep with rabbit sperm, all the while dismissing doubters as right-wing elements. The novel ends with the new capitalism of the ‘90s with fraudsters becoming rich on beauty products and trying to produce a Phoenix through cross-fertilisation.\nIn Mo Yan, a forgotten peasant world arises, alive and well, before our eyes, sensually scented even in its most pungent vapours, startlingly merciless but tinged by joyful selflessness. Never a dull moment. The author knows everything and can describe everything – all kinds of handicraft, smithery, construction, ditch-digging, animal husbandry, the tricks of guerrilla bands. He seems to carry all human life on the tip of his pen.\nHe is more hilarious and more appalling than most in the wake of Rabelais and Swift — in our time, in the wake of García Marquez. His spice blend is a peppery one. On his broad tapestry of China’s last hundred years, there are neither dancing unicorns nor skipping maidens. But he paints life in a pigsty in such a way that we feel we have been there far too long. Ideologies and reform movements may come and go but human egoism and greed remain. So Mo Yan defends small individuals against all injustices – from Japanese occupation to Maoist terror and today’s production frenzy.\nFor those who venture to Mo Yan’s home district, where bountiful virtue battles the vilest cruelty, a staggering literary adventure awaits. Has ever such an epic spring flood engulfed China and the rest of the world? In Mo Yan’s work, world literature speaks with a voice that drowns out most contemporaries.\nThe Swedish Academy congratulates you.

In her writing,\nAlice Munro\nportrays with almost anthropological precision a recognisable, tranquil everyday world with predictable external accoutrements; her equivalent of William Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County is located in south-western Ontario. This flat Canadian agricultural landscape, with its broad rivers and seemingly bland small towns, is where most of her short stories unfold. But the serenity and simplicity are deceptive in every way.\nThe tranquillity of the outer world is always apparent in Alice Munro’s works, which then open the portals to an inner world where the opposite is true. Munro writes about what are usually called ordinary people, but her intelligence, compassion and astonishing power of perception enable her to give their lives a remarkable dignity – indeed redemption – since she shows how much of the extraordinary can fit into that jam-packed emptiness called The Ordinary. The trivial and trite are intertwined with the amazing and unfathomable – but never at the cost of contradiction. If you have never before fantasised about the strangers you see on a bus, you begin doing so after having read Alice Munro.\nHer short stories rely very little on external drama. They are an emotional chamber play, a world of silences and lies, waiting and longing. The biggest events occur inside of her characters. The greatest pain remains unexpressed. Like few others, she is interested in the silent and the silenced, the passive, those who choose not to choose, who live on the sidelines, the quitters and losers. Barriers of gender and class are never far away in her works.\nIn the mental topography that is Munro’s own, what might have happened is often just as important as what actually happened. Of key importance are all the things her characters could not or did not wish to understand there and then, but that only long afterward stand revealed, at best in the form of an epiphany. She shows that our innermost self is essentially inaccessible to other people, often eluding even ourselves – until it is too late.\nIn an uncompromising way, Alice Munro demonstrates that love rarely saves us or leads to reliable happiness, and that few things can be as devastating to us as our own dreams. Sexuality is constantly present and its power is gripping, but often blind and even devastating. Even though genuine happiness may occur, sometimes accidentally, people rarely go unpunished for believing in romantic love. This might seem unbearably dark, or even painful, if her piercing lucidity were not mixed with something that – for want of a better word – I must call tenderness. If you read a lot of Alice Munro’s works carefully, sooner or later, in one of her short stories, you will come face to face with yourself; this is an encounter that always leaves you shaken and often changed, but never crushed.\nThe seemingly prosaic surface level in Alice Munro’s short stories is interwoven in an interesting way with her writing style and distinctive storytelling technique. The minimalist style we encounter is clean, transparent, subtle and stunningly precise. It is a challenge to find an unessential word or a superfluous phrase. Reading one of her texts is like watching a cat walk across a laid dinner table. A brief short story can often cover decades, summarising a life, as she moves deftly between different periods. No wonder Alice Munro is often able to say more in 30 pages than an ordinary novelist is capable of in 300. She is a virtuoso of the elliptical and – as the Academy said in its brief prize citation – the master of the contemporary short story.\nOver the years, numerous prominent scientists have received their well-deserved reward in this auditorium for having solved some of the great enigmas of the universe or of our material existence. But you, Alice Munro, like few others, have come close to solving the greatest mystery of them all: the human heart and its caprices.\nThe Swedish Academy congratulates you.

For example, I was   sure of having lived in occupied Paris since I remembered certain characters of that epoch and small unsettling details such as are never mentioned   in history books. However, I tried to resist the weight pulling me backwards and dreamed of being freed of my poisoned memory. I would have   given anything to be stricken with amnesia.”\nHere Modiano had abandoned the staccato rhythm characteristic of his   first three novels and discovered in\nVilla Triste\n(1975) the meditative legato   we now associate with his novels. But the road to it, which was also the   road to his masterpiece\nDora Bruder\n(1997), could not be taken for granted.\nIf we take Modiano at his word, he was twenty when he discovered the horrifying sphere of experience that had befallen him: occupied France   with its collaborators and shady small-timers, incarnated by an elusive yet   cherished father figure. Readers who from the mature novels come upon   his debut will inevitably be taken aback when the door is flung open to the   noisy room of the main character’s consciousness, in which the contradictory reality of the Occupation years is presented as a cruel farce with the   protagonist, Raphaël Schlemilovitch, in the role of “the sixth of the Marx brothers”.\nClearly, it was not easy in the mid-1960s to come to terms with the reality   of the Occupation. Still, Modiano courageously and independently took   up this challenge in his first three novels and – together with director and   co-scriptwriter Louis Malle – in the controversial film\nLacombe Lucien\n(1974). His exploration of the history of the Occupation, still synonymous   around 1970 with the legends of the Resistance, was independent not least   in that it was completely inopportune.\nIn other words: the revaluation of the Vichy period undertaken by the   American historian Robert Paxton around 1970 and now largely accepted was anticipated by the young Modiano, who with his extraordinary, intuitive understanding of the life-world of the Occupation might even be said   to have fulfilled a mission.\n1975 saw the publication of\nVilla Triste\n, no doubt a turning point in Modiano’s development towards the calm prose associated with his name today.   The title seems at first to refer to an elegant yet melancholy resort in the   French Alps but this impression is deceptive: though not a word suggests it,\nvilla triste\nis the Italian term for the buildings where the Fascists tortured   opponents during the last years of WWII. Seen against this background,   the break between the first three novels and\nVilla Triste\nbecomes less important. The title discreetly points both to a harrowing past and to a seemingly innocent amnesia, cancelled twenty years later in\nDora Bruder\n.\nIn novel upon novel Modiano has developed his ability to use almost non-existent documentation – old telephone numbers, street addresses – to endow the past with entrancing life and his Parisian cityscape with a singular   voice. Magnificently, his work instantiates what an earlier Nobel Laureate,\nSeamus Heaney\n, called “the poetry of place”.\nDear Patrick Modiano, Alfred Nobel’s testament stipulates that the Nobel   Prize for Literature be awarded to the author of the most outstanding work   produced “during the preceding year”. In many earlier cases, the time aspect had to be disregarded but this year it is highly relevant.\nIn 2013 a 1,000-page volume entitled\nRomans\nwas published, comprising   ten of your previous novels. Though in one sense a reprint, this is also a   new totality not reducible to the sum of its components.\nFor this collection allows us to understand how your “little music” is part   of the grand one, with its variations, echoes, and repetitions, as autobiography merges with fiction, inviting us to reread your entire oeuvre, including those novels not selected for the omnibus edition but forming part of   the same vertiginous project.\nDear Patrick Modiano, may I convey to you the warm congratulations of   the Swedish Academy and invite you to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Svetlana Alexievich has met this requirement.\n“Voices of Utopia” – her suite of five books describing the catastrophes of the 20th century – is Alexievich’s literary and moral masterpiece, a charting of the Soviet citizen’s mental history that she associates with a grave, a bloodbath and an endless dialogue between executioners and victims, concealing as much as possible. The work, she says, is about “Russia’s stifled scream”, about a past that must not return, a now that cannot be accepted, a future that proffers no hope.\nLike a stenographer in a high court, she enumerates the injustices visited on the unprepared and defenceless. Here are the words of thousands of witnesses for the first and only time. Without her, they would never have seen the light.\nShe looks for the instant that shakes a person to the core. As in\nVoices from Chernobyl,\nwhen a nurse warns a woman that her beloved has nowbecome a reactor, not a man, but the woman ignores her, and lets the radiationfrom the man’s body take the life of the baby she is carrying insideher. The book becomes a reminder of how past radiation dictates our lives,our morality, for decades.\nIn\nWar’s Unwomanly Face,\nAlexievich interviews five hundred of the countless women who served in the Red Army. They tell of Germans displaying the severed legs of prisoners from foxholes, a mother who drowned her crying baby so as not to betray her village, and how women made hair curlers from pinecones. Back at home they were seen as soldiers’ whores and rejected by their families. Men were the heroes, the women were denied medals.\nAlexievich uncovers the face of evil in a truth process where “heat incinerates the lies” and in language that, between the lines, conveys the silence of pain. She waits until the voices lodge in her, acquiring a harder sheen. This makes her the most sensitive of contemporary historians and a genre innovator.\nIn her dry matter-of-factness, in her striving to keep her eyes open rather than filled with tears, she unnerves us, her readers – especially in this year of refugee flux when her stories of the stubbornness and courage of the helpless are more apt than ever. Having grown up in a culture of sorrow – more localised: near the mined forests of Belarus, a country where every fourth inhabitant was killed – her love is for the little people, not the grand ideas.\nThe oral narrative is literature’s wellspring. Through memory, people retain the contours of their existence. To frame a history, a face, and to render them visible, one after the other, is a magnanimous act and a documentary bequest to the future – and an artistic accomplishment that is matchless of its kind.\nUsing questioning and listening as her secret weapons, Alexievich burrows into the feelings of the extras of history, the disregarded. She finds love and death, thirst for power, and unexpected solidarity. She calls herself a historian of the soul. Her study is of the human mystery.\nAlexievich unifies the historian’s precision with the empathy of a poet in a lament that echoes all conceivable experience. She is a lie detector and an inexhaustible source of knowledge – about obedience as a curse, propaganda as seduction. In brief: the human condition. For, as she exhorts us, “There is only one way out: to begin to love people. To understand them with the help of love.”\nDear Svetlana Alexievich, the Swedish Academy congratulates you and invites you to now receive this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature from the hands of His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Often it is when someone seizes upon a simple, overlooked form, discounted as art in the higher sense, and makes it mutate. Thus, at one point, emerged the modern novel from anecdote and letter, thus arose drama in a new age from high jinx on planks placed on barrels in a marketplace, thus songs in the vernacular dethroned learned Latin poetry, thus too did La Fontaine take animal fables and Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales from the nursery to Parnassian heights. Each time this occurs, our idea of literature changes.\nIn itself, it ought not to be a sensation that a singer/songwriter now stands recipient of the literary Nobel Prize. In a distant past, all poetry was sung or tunefully recited, poets were rhapsodes, bards, troubadours; ‘lyrics’ comes from ‘lyre’. But what Bob Dylan did was not to return to the Greeks or the Provençals. Instead, he dedicated himself body and soul to 20th century American popular music, the kind played on radio stations and gramophone records for ordinary people, white and black: protest songs, country, blues, early rock, gospel, mainstream music. He listened day and night, testing the stuff on his instruments, trying to learn. But when he started to write similar songs, they came out differently. In his hands, the material changed. From what he discovered in heirloom and scrap, in banal rhyme and quick wit, in curses and pious prayers, sweet nothings and crude jokes, he panned poetry gold, whether on purpose or by accident is irrelevant; all creativity begins in imitation.\nEven after fifty years of uninterrupted exposure, we are yet to absorb music’s equivalent of the fable’s Flying Dutchman. He makes good rhymes, said a critic, explaining greatness. And it is true. His rhyming is an alchemical substance that dissolves contexts to create new ones, scarcely containable by the human brain. It was a shock. With the public expecting poppy folk songs, there stood a young man with a guitar, fusing the languages of the street and the bible into a compound that would have made the end of the world seem a superfluous replay. At the same time, he sang of love with a power of conviction everyone wants to own. All of a sudden, much of the bookish poetry in our world felt anaemic, and the routine song lyrics his colleagues continued to write were like old-fashioned gunpowder following the invention of dynamite. Soon, people stopped comparing him to Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams and turned instead to Blake, Rimbaud, Whitman, Shakespeare.\nIn the most unlikely setting of all – the commercial gramophone record – he gave back to the language of poetry its elevated style, lost since the Romantics. Not to sing of eternities, but to speak of what was happening around us. As if the oracle of Delphi were reading the evening news.\nRecognising that revolution by awarding Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize was a decision that seemed daring only beforehand and already seems obvious. But does he get the prize for upsetting the system of literature? Not really. There is a simpler explanation, one that we share with all those who stand with beating hearts in front of the stage at one of the venues on his never-ending tour, waiting for that magical voice. Chamfort made the observation that when a master such as La Fontaine appears, the hierarchy of genres – the estimation of what is great and small, high and low in literature – is nullified. “What matter the rank of a work when its beauty is of the highest rank?” he wrote. That is the straight answer to the question of how Bob Dylan belongs in literature: as the beauty of his songs is of the highest rank.\nBy means of his oeuvre, Bob Dylan has changed our idea of what poetry can be and how it can work. He is a singer worthy of a place beside the Greeks’ ἀοιδόι, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the Blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards. If people in the literary world groan, one must remind them that the gods don’t write, they dance and they sing. The good wishes of the Swedish Academy follow Mr. Dylan on his way to coming bandstands.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach 2025.

He is young, merely a boy. Unwrapping the present, he finds several sheets of paper. Have his friends played a joke on him? Finally, he unpacks an old leather case, and hidden in it – a magnifying glass.\nThe magnifying glass has no bearing on the plot. It is simply a detail. But even so, it carries meaning. The scene provides us with an image for Kazuo Ishiguro’s outstanding art. Turning page after page, gripped by a desire to discover what is hidden between the lines, and finally opening the case, we find ourselves in possession of – a magnifying glass. This is Kazuo Ishiguro’s gift to the reader: an optical device to help us human beings see ourselves, submerged as we are in a violent history without end.\nTo read Ishiguro is to enter a stylistic world that is gloriously unpretentious. The prose is controlled, restrained and exact, at times even dry. But then movement begins under the splendid clauses. A tremour approaches. This is when the undertext reveals itself.\nAn Ishiguro story is like a mix of Jane Austen and Franz Kafka. This may sound odd. Strictly speaking, it should be impossible. But Ishiguro shows that it works. It works well indeed. Herein lies much of his greatness. On the one hand, there is depiction of the ordinary, the enforced protocols of social life, the irrevocable ironies of human existence. On the other hand, an awareness of the absurdly comical, like Kafka’s Gregor Samsa waking up after a restless night only to realise that he has been transformed into an insect.\nThe novel\nThe Remains of the Day\n(1989) opens with the guileless diary entries made by Mr Stephens as he motors through an English landscape to meet an old friend from the 1930s. Before we know it, we are sliding down into the abyss of existence. The novel concludes in tragedy – a tragedy of missed opportunities. As a bonus, one gets a sociology of an older class society. Yet the perspective includes a redemptive aspect – not, to be sure, concerning the social order, but certainly the people in it. Ishiguro’s world is a world without heroes. And equally important: there are no predators in sight – and consequently no victims.\nHis writing comes out of the realistic nineteeth-century tradition, with innovators such as Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Brontë and George Eliot. This was when the novel opened its window onto the quotidian world. Ishiguro too is an innovator, always taking risks. With every new book he investigates a new genre-mix, with elements of the detective story, science fiction, myth … The window of the novel has always been wide. Ishiguro has widened it even more.\nWhat about early twentieth-century modernism? Did it never happen? It is hard to imagine Ishiguro without Kafka, but also without Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and others who have explored new literary terrain, in particular human consciousness. This is where to situate Ishiguro on the literary map. And yet this is only background. Ishiguro’s writing is characterised by a striking integrity. His viewpoint is his alone. He writes about different kinds of people: a Japanese mother whose daughter committed suicide in the years after the second world war; a male pianist from England preparing for a crucial recital; a female guardian at the terrifying Hailsham boarding school … What do these stories have in common? The reader must search for the root hairs, but they exist. All his books, each in its own way, inquire into the relationship between present and past. We call this relationship memory.\nWriters such as Proust and Woolf attempt to salvage the past. Ishiguro’s purpose is different. He journeys with his stories as though they were diving bells, making discoveries in the mighty sea of amnesia. Above all, he explores in detail how we interact with the past and what we – as individuals, communities, societies – also must forget in order to survive at all.\nDear Mr Ishiguro,\nit is my great pleasure to convey to you the warm congratulations of the Swedish Academy and to ask you to receive from the hands of His Majesty the King the Nobel Prize for Literature for 2017.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Poland, Europe’s crossroads, perhaps its heart – its history exposes to Olga Tokarczuk a victim ravaged by great powers but with its own history of colonialism and anti-semitism. She does not retreat from unpalatable truth, even under threat of death.\nHer fusion of intensive embodiment and ephemeral unreality, intimate observation and mythological obsession, make her one of our time’s most original prose writers, with new ways of viewing reality. She is a virtuoso of instant portraiture, capturing characters in the act of escaping daily life. She writes of what no one else does: “the world’s excruciating strangeness”.\nFlights\nis a wonderfully varied description of passage through transit halls and hotels; meetings with figures we know so little of; and a shower of items from dictionaries, fairy tales and documents. She circles the poles of nature-culture, reason-madness, male-female, and scoots like a sprinter across socially and culturally fabricated borders.\nHer prose – drastic, rich in ideas – is in nomadic movement throughout her fifteen or so books. Her villages are centres of the universe, the place a protagonist, its singular destinies woven into a fresco of fable and myth. We live and die in the stories of others, where Katyn for example is at once a forest, at once a massacre.\n“My writing is a translation of images to words.” From these images arise apocalyptic histories and mundane episodes, and form her magnum opus,\nThe Books of Jacob\n, into a picaresque novel and a vibrant panorama of the period around 1752.\nIt is history-of-ideas and religious history, it is the compulsions of the time and metaphysics, superstition and madness. It is salons and prayer meetings and people so alive and up-close that Tokarczuk might just have met them on the street. She lavishes on interiors of country manors, monasteries and Jewish homes, with dresses, gardening, menus. Not least, she turns anonymous women into individuals, giving a voice to menials disappeared without trace.\nThe sect leader, Jakob Frank, is a charismatic mystic, manipulator and swindler, a rebel provoking God. He questions current order, especially the submission of women. With his adherents, the Frankists, he wants to bring about a new world. This was also the Nazis’ rationale for obliterating Poland. Utopias are siren calls replacing our historical memory. But we never meet the Messiah, only forgers and frauds.\nGlimpsed in subtext are Tokarczuk’s Jewish heritage and her hope for a Europe without borders for knowledge. In 18th-century Poland she sees parallels with a later era’s Nazism and Stalinism, even with current rightwing populists who – in her words – speak of a country’s past like in a boys’ book about heroes and traitors. But, she says, “there is no history, only people’s lives”.\nThe Books of Jacob\nis an extraordinary tale. The great questions of evil, God and the future are stitched together in a prosaic portrayal in which Tokarczuk, using her sensual imagination, ponders a coffee grinder and makes of it a time-grinder, reality’s own axis. Generations to come will return to Olga Tokarczuk’s thousand-paged miracle to discover a richness we barely discern today. I see Alfred Nobel nodding in friendly approval from his heaven.\nMs Tokarczuk, the Swedish Academy congratulates you.

Photo: Alexander Mahmoud.\nEnglish\nSwedish\nSwedish Academy\n, Chairman of the Nobel Committee for Literature, 10 December 2019.\nYour\nMajesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Esteemed Nobel Laureates, Ladies and Gentlemen:\nContemporary literature is blooming like never before on alien shores. Such a place is No-Man’s Bay, Peter Handke’s name for the place southwest of Paris that has been his residence for thirty years. Peter Handke, born in Kärnten in Austria, has worked abroad for almost his entire writing career. He has freely chosen exile as a productive path, from where he depicts not metro- polises but the peripheries. In the sweeping story of\nMy Year in the No-Man’s-Bay\nthe narrator describes in scrupulous detail the backwater where he lives. Just as prominent as the noise from a neighbour’s lawnmower, or madcap arias, is the beguiling buzz of wild bees in the rocks or the bristly whiskers of the beaver rats in the nameless pond. Is “pond” the right word? Ask Flaubert! Periphery has become centre.\nPeter Handke’s work is suffused with a strong spirit of discovery, a desire to write the world fresh. In his debut year, 1966, he attacked the literary world for its short- comings in describing reality, but over fifty years later, with about 80 works behind him – including films and about a score of plays – it is evident not only that he has realised his dream of a new prose, but also how his writing has become influential for several generations of writers in post-war Europe.\nIn his extraordinary\nRepetition\n, Handke allows his narrator to revisit his childhood environs in eastern Slovenia. He checks into an inn where he makes friends with a waiter. Coming back late one night he sees from his window the waiter carrying a stack of dishes to a stream close by. With graceful movements, he launches them one by one onto the water, letting them sail away. The scene, as mysterious as it is unforgettable, is described dispassionately and without comment. It seems that here, a dream is born of another existence.\nHandke’s writing is often about returning to origins to remember the dead, but no strict iteration is possible. In\nA Sorrow Beyond Dreams: A Life Story\n, the stark portrayal of his mother after her suicide in 1971, he lets us experience the extent of the catastrophe through his elucidating gaze and restrained language.\nPeter Handke’s groundbreaking artistry with language emerges when his hyperactive sense for the particular compels investigation of his own medium. In his books we are often on foot, and his “epic steps” appear with full effect in his story\nSlow Homecoming\n1979. The story being told has almost dissolved in description, but the telling still lives on, guided by the narrator’s grounded feet and a gaze gifted with linguistic eyes. He has written: “To be receptive is everything”.\nPeter Handke has said that the classics not only saved him but also preserved him. But he is also a deeply contemporary writer who must confront a paternal heritage perverted by the Nazis’ occupation of Austria in the war. He represents a Slovenian maternal lineage, which motivates his anti-nationalistic myth of his origin.\nPeriphery becomes centre again in Handke’s latest major work,\nThe Fruit Thief\n, a trek from No-Man’s Bay to the heart of Picardy. Place names glow and every step uncovers new fissures in reality. As so often, Handke rejects contemporary conformity and allows a hunt through brush for a lost cat to become a main theme. And when he shows us the miracle of meetings, he finds it with the stateless, with the young pizza delivery man on his scooter, and with the mythically shimmering fruit thief herself, Alexia.\nLieber Peter Handke, Ich möchte die wärmsten Glück- wünsche der Schwedischen Akademie aussprechen, wenn ich Sie jetzt auffordere, den Nobelpreis für Literatur 2019 aus der Hand Seiner Majestät des Königs entgegenzunehmen.\nDear Peter Handke, I would like to convey the warmest congratulations of the Swedish Academy, as I call on you to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature for 2019 from the hand of His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Photo: Dan Lepp\nEnglish\nSwedish\nSwedish Academy\n, Chairman of the Nobel Committee for Literature, 10 December 2020.\nYour Majesties, Esteemed Nobel Laureates, Ladies and Gentlemen\nEverything finds new meaning in retrospect. In the American poet Louise Glück’s work\nFaithful and V\nirtuous N\night\nfrom 2014 there is a poem titled “Afterword”, not at the end of the book but in the middle.  The poem is an intermission, where the person speaking takes a pause to reread what he has written. The speaker is an elderly painter who has reached the critical point where his brush freezes at the aspect of chaos and where he has to confront belief in individual fate. He talks about the philosopher Immanuel Kant’s “exalted solitude” on his walks to the bridges of Königsberg. Parenthetically, the painter adds: “(We share a birthday.)” Checking, you find that Louise Glück was born on the same day as Kant, the 22nd of April, and Kant’s themes are also hers: they include the sublime, but also our imprisonment in perceptions and difficulties in grasping reality. The writing painter is a thin mask for the poet to enunciate through.\nLouise Glück’s poems are written in retrospect. Childhood and taut relationships with parents and siblings are motifs that have never loosened their grip. Glück has produced twelve collections of poetry and a couple of volumes of essays on poetry, all marked by a drive for clarity. Nobody is more adamant than she against self-illusions. The autobiographical material is crucial, but Glück is scarcely a confessional poet. The “truth” to be revealed detours through imagination and vicarious voices, like the painter´s. In several of her books, Glück speaks through mythical figures such as Dido, Persephone or Eurydice. They are masks transcribing private intimacies into something as universal  as it is ambiguous. Glücks lyrical discourse has one of its premises in the divided self, as testified by the red poppy in the collection\nThe Wild Iris\nfrom 1992:  “in truth / I am speaking now / the way you do. I speak / because I am shattered.” In her writing two contentious truths can share the last word. And this is what happens in her poem “Afterword”:\nShall I be raised from death\n, the spirit asks.\nAnd the sun says yes.\nAnd the desert answers\nyour voice is sand scattered in wind.\nAside from the world of classical myth, Glück’s principal literary reservoir is the rich heritage of English-language poetry. It can be what she has called the ”inward listening” in John Keats, the solitary, demanding voice of Emily Dickinson, or the tone of urgency in\nT.S. Eliot\n. She is drawn to the intimate voice that invites participation. Significant is Glück’s discovery how to make poetry of her spoken language in the\nArarat\ncollection from 1990. She gives us almost brutally open-hearted images of family life, freed from all poetic edifice, but also a masterly sense of lyrical form and architecture.\nLouise Glück is a writer not only of contradictions and austere reflection. She is also a poet of renewal, with few coequals. Even if her poetry is written in retrospect, and seems bound to the apple tree as it was seen once in childhood, one of her keywords is change. She teaches us that the moment of renewal is also the arrival of words. Her inner driving force is a spiritual hunger and an exceptional reverence for the possibilities of poetry. The leap of renewal can employ the seemingly plain diction of thoughtful parables, but also comedy and biting wit. And when Louise Glück in her later work confronts the inevitable end, there is a remarkable grace and lightness in her touch. It is a note that lingers and can carry us readers forward as well.\nDear Louise Glück, on behalf of the Swedish Academy, it is my privilege to convey to you our warmest congratulations to the Nobel Prize in Literature 2020.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Photo: Dan Lepp\nEnglish\nSwedish\nSwedish Academy\n, Member of the Nobel Committee for Literature, 10 December 2021.\nYour Majesties, Esteemed Nobel Prize laureates, Ladies and Gentlemen\nA story is told again and again in Abdulrazak Gurnah’s novels. It concerns a boy who disappears or is kidnapped, sold, taken like Moses from the bulrushes, or is fleeing to save his life. He grows into a young man living where he doesn’t belong, where he is forced to find ways of managing both the sorrow of ruptured contact with the past, and also the shock of encountering a society that is basically hostile. The strategies he tries are irony, withdrawal, silence and lies.\nHere, lies equate to literary fiction; along with much else, Gurnah’s writing is about the genesis of writers and how stories emerge as a means of understanding what has happened, but also creating an alternative: an improved or simply different version to offer loved ones and use as a shield against revealing light. But the protection transforms over time into a sickness, a Nessus Tunic that destroys its wearer, and the young man becomes slightly older, then finally an old man fossilised in a life lie, trying to break a silence that has become a wall against the world.\nOnce upon a time there was a boy, so begins the story. At the dawn of time\n,\nwhich is how all stories begin. The writer’s job is to see that this continues, to defer to it and shepherd it to closure. Only when a story is complete can we understand the meaning of all the episodes, of the mysterious ties that bind, and the deepest sense in the final chord that everything leads up to. Only when it has subsided is the music whole and coherent. It is the story of our time and all others that is told in novels such as\nPilgrims Way\n,\nParadise, Afterlives\nand\nDesertion\n. It is about losing one’s place in the world then searching for a new place, resisting slavery even when it appears disguised and in tempting form. To enter Gurnah’s writing is to absorb the great oral narrative tradition’s patterns and mythologies, conflated with the premise of the art of the novel: the uniqueness of every fate. Gurnah describes exile, but never in general terms; he writes not about historical processes but about people subservient to history, their lives shaped by it, but always each in their own way, with preconditions from the distant past ‒ the dawn of time, if you will. As in\nA Thousand and One Nights,\nthey tell stories to get through the night, and we recognise the voice of the old tale, but the storytellers are modern individuals; they are benificent, snobbish, super-sensitive, cowardly and heroic, as complex and contradictory as in a Shakespeare play or a Joseph Conrad novel. Here, two literary traditions meet and organically merge into a third, something exceptionally beautiful.\nEveryone has a dream for their own life and must sustain that dream through challenges along the way. Ultimately, rootlessness is perhaps the only place that can be claimed. It holds those whose lives have been splintered but who have been able to retain within them what is most important and fragile.\nDear Abdulrazak Gurnah, on behalf of the Swedish Academy it is my privilege to convey to you our warmest congratulations on the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2021.\nTranslated by Kim Loughran\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Where is the delineation between “fiction” and “reality”? Few have tackled the issue with the commitment of Annie Ernaux. Charged by the words of poet Arthur Rimbaud – “Je suis de race inférieure de toute éternité” (“I have always belonged to an inferior race”) – she determined early on to rehabilitate the social class she rose from. Driving her is a force and a demand for justice, but instead of emulating the poet’s language of imagination to transfigure reality, she chose a different path. For Ernaux, language is a means to dispel the fog of memory and a knife to uncover the real.\nHer debut from 1974,\nCleaned Out\n, was the commencement of Annie Ernaux’s study of her maturation in the little Normandy community of Yvetot, a work of reconstruction that has endured in her writing. The first three books were still narrative accounts labelled ‘novels’ and in the impassioned debut, the 20-year-old main character, fleeing from her social constraints, is a fictitious character called Denise Lesur. But Ernaux soon abandoned her fictional devices. She has said that her debut work could equally have been called “Getting rid of Annie Duchesne”, her maiden name. This is revelatory regarding her ambitions. Ernaux always writes autobiographically in a wider sense, setting the ego in a larger social and historical context. In her most elaborated work,\nThe Years\n, it results in what has been called “collective autobiography”, written not in the first person but in the third, and where her own life story fuses with the development of French society over six decades.\nAnnie Ernaux’s breakthrough came with\nA Man’s Place\n(1983), in its brevity a masterful portrait of her father and the working class background that marked him. The book could be written only from the other side of the class barrier she was forced to transgress to become the writer she is. She writes in solidarity with her father to overcome her self-perceived treachery against his world. The language is as received, with her father’s simple phrases seemingly engraved in the strictly factual text. Ernaux’s vision is double, aware to what she has witnessed as a daughter, but also revealing the distance she has, with time, accrued. In\nA Woman’s Story\nshe writes about her mother in prose as harsh as it is perceptive, as later in\nL’autre fille\nabout the sister who died young of diphtheria before Annie knew her and never spoken of by their parents. This extraordinary book, written in the form of a letter to her sister, bears a strong inner drama, wherein Ernaux tries to reconcile the absence of her sister.\nAnnie Ernaux’s writing is restrained with feelings and expressions of emotion, but passion pulses beneath the surface. Relentlessly, Ernaux exposes the shame that penetrates class experience. This occurs in\nShame\n, where her father’s situation is exposed in scenes that are as suffused with violence as they are humiliating. And from another direction in her depiction of her illegal abortion at the age of 23, in\nHappening\n, so devastating in its succinctness and controlled rage. She has written: “I have always desired to write books that would be impossible to talk about, that make the gaze of the other unbearable.”\nAn unrelenting gaze and a plain style are Annie Ernaux’s characteristics, and that she succeeds in making her pain relevant to all.\nDear Annie Ernaux,\nallow me to convey the warm congratulations of the Swedish Academy, while asking you to step forward to receive from the hand of his Majesty the King the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nTranslated by Kim Loughran\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

His rich oeuvre revolves around the disorientation of the individual and the difficulties experienced in finding a path in life. Whether in prose, drama or poetry, his writing approaches a state of uncertainty that can open a relation to the divine. With commonplace words here seeming inadequate, Fosse’s rare quality is that he succeeds, as the award citation reads, in ‘giving voice to the unsayable’.\nEarly on in his authorship, Fosse captures the unsayable in his short prose piece\nI Couldn’t Say It to You\nfrom 1991. Here we meet an old man who is unable to rid himself of the vivid memory of something he has failed to say to his beloved throughout all their years together. He has not forgotten the look in her eyes as she sits alone at a table in the school cafeteria, a memory that remains lodged in his mind from that day forward. This is the case even on her deathbed; words and life have drifted apart. But when Fosse allows the old man to voice the unsaid, the impossible is transformed into both a touching elegy and a triumph over speechlessness.\nIn the late masterpiece\nSeptology\n, completed in 2021, the main character Asle is an elderly artist who, in the spirit of the medieval Christian mystic Meister Eckhart, turns in prayer to a God beyond all concepts and ideas. Both in the previously mentioned early piece and here in this later novel, the protagonist is nevertheless filled with an anxiety which creates a tension between the mundane and the divine. It is this anxiety that lends the work its internal drama.\nJon Fosse is not a difficult writer. He uses the simplest of words and writes about experiences to which we can all relate: separation, death and the vulnerability of love. Any difficulty with Fosse rather concerns our readiness to open ourselves to the existential uncertainty upon which he constantly touches. But the fact that he is one of today’s most widely performed playwrights indicates that this is a torment shared by many.\nWhat is remarkable about Fosse’s simplicity is that it gains depth and intensity through repetition and variation. In his harrowing early novel\nClosed Guitar\n, in which a mother locks herself out of her flat and becomes separated from her baby daughter, a sense of panic merges into the language form. In the shimmering world of\nMorning and Evening\n, anxiety turns to wonder and profound consolation as an old man named Johannes awakes one morning to find he is dying and begins to lose his sense of reality. In\nSeptology,\nthe rolling prose devoid of sentence breaks becomes one with the painter Asle’s wandering thoughts, drawing in the reader with hypnotic power.\nEither Fosse focuses on the unsayable, as in these works, or he chooses the language of silence, as in his radical renewal of world drama during the 1990s. Beginning with\nSomeone Is Going to Come\n, the play with which he made his international breakthrough, he discovers the possibility of allowing speechlessness to materialize on stage. In the theatre, all that is internal must be revealed, and what cannot be said must too be given a voice. This is demonstrated in a long series of emotionally charged plays that includes\nThe Name\n,\nDream of Autumn\nand\nDeath Variations\n. Here, time expands to allow the dead to take their place on stage.\nJon Fosse is the first Nobel Prize laureate in Literature to write in Nynorsk and, like his great Norwegian predecessor Tarjei Vesaas, he combines strong local ties with a belief in the possibilities of contemporary literature. He shies away from what we might consider to be definitive wording, making it almost impossible to quote him. As such, he is the master of ambivalence and of the unresolved. In his world, uncertainty pulses with a secret light.\nDear Jon Fosse, allow me to convey the warm congratulations of the Swedish Academy, while asking you to step forward to receive from the hand of his Majesty the King the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nTranslation: Chris Hall\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech.

Photo: Nanaka Adachi\nEnglish\nSwedish\nYour Majesties, Esteemed Nobel Laureates, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nTwo colours meet in Han Kang’s writing: white and red. The white is the snow that falls in so many of her books, drawing a protective curtain between the narrator and the world, but white is also the colour of sorrow, and of death. Red stands for life, but also for pain, blood, the deep cuts of a knife. While her voice can be seductively soft, it speaks of indescribable cruelty, of irreparable loss. Blood flows from the bodies piled up after the massacre, darkens, becomes an appeal, a question that the text can neither answer nor ignore: how should we relate to the dead, the abducted, the disappeared? What can we do for them? What do we owe them? The white and the red symbolize a historical experience that Han returns to in her novels.\nIn\nWe Do Not Part\nfrom 2021, the snow creates a space where a meeting can take place between the living and the dead, and those floating in between who are yet to decide which category they belong to. The entire novel is played out within a snowstorm where, in piecing together her memories, the narrative self glides through layers of time, interacting with the shadows of the dead and learning from their knowledge – because ultimately it is always about knowledge and seeking out the truth, unbearable though it may be. In one exquisitely realized evocation, the friend, despite her physical body being confined to a hospital bed many miles away, is able to pull out a box of files from a shelf and find a document that adds a further piece to the historical mosaic. The dream spills over into reality, the past into the present. These shifts, by which boundaries are dissolved, are a constant in Han’s writing, where people move around unhindered, their feelers pointing in both directions, ready to gather and interpret signals. Perhaps they are broken down by what they see and witness, which always comes at the price of their own peace of mind. And yet they keep on going with the strength that is required. Forgetting is never the goal.\n‘Who killed me?’ asks the murdered boy’s soul, as the facial features that defined him in life dissolve and disappear. For the survivor, the question is a different one: how can I live on with this body that has only led me to torment? How can I regain the body that torture has reduced to nothing but a bleeding object? But when the body gives up, the soul continues to speak.\nWhen the soul tires, the body keeps on walking. Deep within lies a stubborn resistance, a quiet insistence stronger than words, a need to remember: again, it is not the aim to forget, nor would it be possible. In Han’s world, people are wounded, fragile, in some sense weak, and yet they possess just enough strength, and just the right kind of strength, to take another step or ask another question, request another document or interview another surviving witness. As the light fades, the shadows of the dead continue to move around on the wall. Nothing ever passes; nothing ever ends.\nDear Han Kang\n, on behalf of the Swedish Academy, it is my privilege to convey to you our warmest congratulations on the Nobel Prize in Literature 2024. May I now please ask you to step forward and receive your prize from His Majesty the King.\nTo cite this section\nMLA style: Award ceremony speech. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach 2025.
