Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies                  and Gentlemen,
Gao Xingjian’s literary output comprises eighteen plays, two great                  novels, and a number of stories, which all fit in one volume.                  Born in 1940, he began his career as a writer as early as the                  sixties. His production would certainly have been much larger                  had not the conditions of life during the Cultural Revolution                  forced him to burn all his manuscripts of the sixties and the                  seventies. He also made very important contributions to the theoretical                  debate concerning the structure and functions of drama and the                  novel in China during the eighties. His work as a breaker of new                  ground relates to the form and structure of a literary work as                  well as to its psychological foundations.
The novel called
Soul Mountain
(1990) stands out as one of                the foremost works in twentieth-century Chinese literature. Among                many other things Gao Xingjian deals in it with an existential dilemma:                man’s urge to find the absolute independence granted by solitude                conflicts with a longing for the warmth and fellowship which can                be given by “the other,” be it he or she. At the same time, however,                this enriching companionship threatens the individual’s integrity                and, without fail, ends in some kind of struggle for power.
The author’s vivid sense of alienation in a politics-ridden society                  made him, in the early eighties, go in search for hidden-away                  parts of southwestern and southern China, where there still existed                  traces of primitive cultures, age-old shamanistic rites and Daoist                  notions. In his portrayal of these cultures, replete with fantastic                  cock-and-bull stories which bring to the reader’s mind the repertoires                  of traditional storytellers, he also castigates strict Confucian                  orthodoxy as well as Marxist ideology and their respective demands                  for obedience and uniformity.
In the course of his pilgrimage to
Soul Mountain,
where he hopes to find the ultimate truth about the meaning of                  life and the human condition, the author’s ego is stricken by                  loneliness and is forced into creating a
you,
a projection                  of itself, which, in turn, hit by the same loneliness, creates                  a
she.
The numerous
he
figures that                  make their appearance in the novel are likewise projections of                  the author’s ego. With the help of these pronominal projections,                  the author manages to investigate a wide range of human relationships                  and their consequences for the individual.
The novel entitled
One Man’s Bible
(1999), which Gao Xingjian                himself looks upon as a companion novel to Soul Mountain, is a novel                of confession in which he mercilessly lays bare the three different                parts he played during the Cultural Revolution: as a leader of a                rebel faction, as a victim and as a silent observer. Again he makes                use of the pronouns
you
and
he
in order to distinguish                between two different degrees of alienation:
you
stands                for the exiled author
here
and
now,
he
is the                author
there
and
then,
in the China of the Cultural                Revolution. The framing chapters, which describe episodes in the                author’s exiled existence, are as factual and personally revealing                as those dealing with his different roles during the Cultural Revolution.                It is these framing chapters that enable the author to give his                view on the meaning of human existence, the nature of literature,                the conditions of authorship and, first and foremost, on the importance                of remembering and of imagination for the author’s view of reality.
The foundation for Gao Xingjian’s pioneering activity as a dramatist                  was laid in the first half of the nineteen-eighties when he worked                  as artistic advisor, director of plays and playwright at the People’s                  Art Theatre in Peking, at that time considered to be the country’s                  foremost stage. Gao Xingjian’s plays are characterized by originality,                  in no way diminished by the fact that he has been influenced both                  by modern Western and traditional Chinese currents. His greatness                  as a dramatist lies in the manner in which he has succeeded in                  enriching these fundamentally different elements and making them                  coalesce to something entirely new.
Dear Gao Xingjian: You did not leave China empty-handed. You have                  come to look on the native language which you brought with you                  when you left China as your true and real country. It gives me                  great joy to offer you, on behalf of the Swedish Academy, our                  warmest congratulations. I will ask you now to receive, from the                  hands of His Majesty the King, this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature.
