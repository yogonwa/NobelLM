Announcement by Anders Österling,   Permanent Secretary of the
Swedish   Academy
Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses,   Ladies and Gentlemen:
This year’s Nobel Prize for Literature has been awarded by the   Swedish Academy to the Soviet-Russian writer Boris Pasternak for   his notable achievement in both contemporary poetry and the field   of the great Russian narrative tradition.
As is well known, Pasternak has sent word that he does not wish   to accept the distinction. This refusal, of course, in no way   alters the validity of the award. There remains only for the   Academy, however, to announce with regret that the presentation   of the Prize cannot take place.

On October 25, 1958, two days after the   official communication from the Swedish Academy that Boris   Pasternak had been selected as the Nobel Prize winner in   literature, the Russian writer sent the following telegram to the   Swedish Academy: “Immensely thankful, touched, proud, astonished,   abashed.” This telegram was followed, on October 29, by another   one with this content: “Considering the meaning this award has   been given in the society to which I belong, I must reject this   undeserved prize which has been presented to me. Please do not   receive my voluntary rejection with displeasure.”
