+# Future Vision: Overlapping Chunks for Embedding
+
+## 📌 Overview
+
+As part of future improvements to the Nobel Literature Speech Explorer, we plan to support **overlapping chunking** during the embedding phase. This technique improves semantic recall and contextual coherence, particularly for long, nuanced content such as lectures and speeches.
+
+---
+
+## ✅ Benefits
+
+- **Improved Contextual Coherence**  
+  Prevents important ideas from being split between chunks.
+
+- **Higher Recall in Semantic Search**  
+  Increases the likelihood that relevant text is retrieved, especially for queries straddling chunk boundaries.
+
+- **Robustness via Redundancy**  
+  Key concepts appear in multiple chunks, increasing surface area for matching queries.
+
+- **Less Sensitivity to Chunk Boundaries**  
+  Reduces risk of edge-case misses due to imperfect paragraph segmentation.
+
+---
+
+## ⚠️ Tradeoffs
+
+- **Increased Embedding Volume**  
+  More chunks = more tokens = higher compute cost (especially for paid APIs like OpenAI).
+
+- **Larger Vector Index**  
+  Increases memory and storage requirements for FAISS or similar databases.
+
+- **Slower Ingestion Time**  
+  More pre-processing, I/O, and embedding operations.
+
+- **Possible Redundancy in Search Results**  
+  Similar or duplicated results may surface unless reranking is applied.
+
+---
+
+## 🔍 Use Cases
+
+| Use Case                                     | Overlap Recommended? |
+|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
+| Nobel lectures / long-form speeches           | ✅ Yes                 |
+| Metadata, blurbs, or short factual segments   | ❌ No                  |
+| MVP with strict token/computation budget      | ⚠️ Optional            |
+| Production-ready search experience            | ✅ Yes                 |
+
+---
+
+## 🚧 Implementation (Post-MVP)
+
+We plan to implement a chunking strategy with overlap after MVP launch. A possible configuration:
+
+- `max_tokens = 250`
+- `stride = 125` (50% overlap)
+- Configurable toggle: `--use-overlap` for scripts
+
+This will be modularized to allow selective use per source type (lecture, ceremony, etc.).
+
+---
+
+## Status: 📅 **Deferred until Post-MVP**
+
+- 2024-06: Pre-retrieval metadata filtering added. Filters are now applied before FAISS search in all retrieval modes. This improves efficiency, privacy, and explainability. Only output fields are exposed in answers.

+- 🛠️ **Centralized model config for easy model switching and reproducibility**
+
+## Pre-retrieval Metadata Filtering
+
+NobelLM now supports **pre-retrieval metadata filtering** at the retrieval layer. This means that any filter (e.g., by gender, country, source_type) is applied to the chunk metadata before vector search (FAISS), ensuring only relevant chunks are searched. This improves efficiency, explainability, and privacy.
+
+- Filters can be passed as a dictionary (e.g., {"gender": "female", "country": "USA"}) to any query.
+- Filtering is supported in both in-process and subprocess retrieval modes.
+- Any metadata field present in the chunk index can be used for filtering.
+- The output schema is privacy-preserving: only public fields (e.g., chunk_id, text_snippet) are returned in answers.
+
+See `tests/README.md` and `tests/test_coverage_plan.md` for integration test coverage.
+
+---
+
+## 🛠️ Model-Aware Configuration
+
+All chunking, embedding, indexing, and RAG operations are now **model-aware and config-driven**. The embedding model, FAISS index, and chunk metadata paths are centrally managed in [`rag/model_config.py`](./rag/model_config.py):
+
+- To switch models (e.g., BGE-Large vs MiniLM), pass `--model` to any CLI tool, or set `model_id` in your code or UI.
+- All file paths, model names, and embedding dimensions are set in one place.
+- Consistency checks ensure the loaded model and index match in dimension, preventing silent errors.
+- Enables easy A/B testing and reproducibility.
+
+**Example:**
+```python
+from rag.query_engine import query
+from rag.model_config import DEFAULT_MODEL_ID
+
+# Query using the default model (BGE-Large)
+response = query("What do laureates say about justice?", dry_run=True)

+```
+
+**To add a new model:**

 This step generates dense vector embeddings for each chunked speech or metadata block using a state-of-the-art sentence transformer. These embeddings are used for semantic search, retrieval, and downstream RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) tasks.
 
 ### Model
-- **Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ([Hugging Face link](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2))
-- **Why this model?** MiniLM offers an excellent balance of speed, memory usage, and semantic accuracy. It is widely used for production-scale semantic search and is compatible with FAISS and other vector stores.

+# 📦 Mini Implementation Plan: Subprocess-Based RAG Retrieval
+
+### 🧠 Problem:
+On macOS with Intel CPUs, **PyTorch and FAISS conflict when loaded in the same process**, causing segmentation faults. This happens when using `bge-large` for embedding alongside FAISS indexing.
+
+---
+
+## ✅ Solution Strategy
+
+**Split query embedding and FAISS retrieval into two separate Python processes:**
+
+1. **Main Driver (query_driver.py)**  
+   - Accepts a user query string
+   - Embeds it using SentenceTransformer (`bge-large`)
+   - Saves embedding to `query_embedding.npy`
+   - Launches subprocess: `python faiss_query_worker.py`
+   - Reads back results from `retrieval_results.json`
+
+2. **FAISS Worker (faiss_query_worker.py)**  
+   - Loads `query_embedding.npy`
+   - Calls `query_index()` from `retriever.py` using `bge-large`
+   - Outputs results to `retrieval_results.json`
+
+---
+
+## 📁 Files to Create
+
+### 1. `query_driver.py`
+\`\`\`python
+import numpy as np
+import json
+import subprocess
+from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
+from model_config import get_model_config

+user_query = "What do laureates say about the creative process?"
+
+# Step 1: Embed query
+model_id = "bge-large"
+config = get_model_config(model_id)
+model = SentenceTransformer(config["model_name"])
+embedding = model.encode(user_query, normalize_embeddings=True)
+
+# Step 2: Save query embedding
+np.save("query_embedding.npy", embedding)
+
+# Step 3: Run FAISS worker

+## 🧪 Test Instructions
+
+\`\`\`bash
+python query_driver.py
+\`\`\`
+
+Expected:
+- `query_embedding.npy` is created
+- `faiss_query_worker.py` runs in isolation (no PyTorch involved)
+- `retrieval_results.json` contains top-k results with metadata
+
+---
+
+## 📁 Summary of Files
+
+| File                     | Purpose                              |
+|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
+| `query_driver.py`        | Embeds query, runs FAISS subprocess   |
+| `faiss_query_worker.py`  | Isolated FAISS-based retriever        |
+| `query_embedding.npy`    | Query vector (inter-process shared)   |
+| `retrieval_results.json` | Retrieved chunks with metadata        |
+
+---
+
+## ✅ Deliverables for Cursor
+
+- Create both scripts as above
+- Test the full flow with a sample query
+- Ensure compatibility with `bge-large` model and current FAISS index
+- Log output paths and retrieval results clearly
+
+
+---
+# 🌐 Environment-Aware Execution Strategy
+
+To support seamless development on macOS (Intel) and production deployment on Hugging Face Spaces or cloud servers, maintain both subprocess and single-process FAISS query modes.
+
+## 🔁 Toggle Between Modes Using Environment Variable
+
+Define a global toggle in `query_engine.py`:
+
+```python
+import os
+
+USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS = os.getenv("NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS", "0") == "1"
+```
+
+### In Dev (MacOS Intel):
+```bash
+export NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS=1
+python query_engine.py
+```
+
+Uses subprocess flow to avoid PyTorch/FAISS conflicts.
+
+### In Production (Hugging Face, Docker, EC2):
+```bash
+unset NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS
+python query_engine.py
+```
+
+Uses fast, unified in-process pipeline.
+
+## 🔧 Implementation Recommendation
+
+Inside `query_engine.py`:
+
+```python
+if USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS:
+    from subprocess_faiss import query_faiss_via_subprocess
+    results = query_faiss_via_subprocess(query_embedding, model_id)
+else:
+    from retriever import query_index
+    results = query_index(query_embedding, model_id=model_id)
+```
+
+This toggle gives you flexibility, safety, and clarity across environments.
+
+---
+
+## ✅ Summary
+
+| Environment       | Execution Mode         | Why                                  |
+|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
+| macOS Intel (dev) | Subprocess (isolated)  | Prevent FAISS/PyTorch segfaults      |
+| Hugging Face      | Unified process        | Fast, stable Linux container runtime |
+| Cloud (EC2, GPU)  | Unified process        | Standard production path             |
+
+Maintain both modes for developer ergonomics and production reliability.

-- Retrieves top-k relevant chunks from FAISS index
+- Embeds user queries using a **model-aware, config-driven approach** (BGE-Large or MiniLM, easily swappable)

+## Model-Aware Configuration
+
+All RAG and embedding logic is now **model-aware and config-driven**. The embedding model, FAISS index, and chunk metadata paths are centrally managed in [`rag/model_config.py`](./model_config.py):
+
+- To swap models (e.g., BGE-Large vs MiniLM), pass `model_id` to the query or embedding functions, or change the default in the config.
+- All file paths, model names, and embedding dimensions are set in one place.
+- Consistency checks ensure the loaded model and index match in dimension, preventing silent errors.
+- Enables easy A/B testing and reproducibility.
+
+**Example:**
+```python
+from rag.query_engine import query
+from rag.model_config import DEFAULT_MODEL_ID
+
+# Query using the default model (BGE-Large)
+response = query("What do laureates say about justice?", dry_run=True)
+
+# Query using MiniLM
+response = query("What do laureates say about justice?", dry_run=True, model_id="miniLM")
+```
+
+**To add a new model:**
+- Add its config to `rag/model_config.py`.
+- All downstream code will pick it up automatically.

+## Environment-Aware FAISS Execution (Mac/Intel vs. Linux/Prod)
+
+**On macOS Intel, set the following environment variable to avoid PyTorch/FAISS segfaults:**
+
+```bash
+export NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS=1
+```
+
+This will run FAISS retrieval in a subprocess, isolating it from PyTorch and preventing native library conflicts.
+
+**On Linux, Hugging Face Spaces, or cloud servers, leave this variable unset for maximum speed:**
+
+```bash
+unset NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS
+```
+
+The pipeline will use a fast, unified in-process retrieval mode.
+
+| Environment       | Execution Mode         | Why                                  |
+|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
+| macOS Intel (dev) | Subprocess (isolated)  | Prevent FAISS/PyTorch segfaults      |
+| Hugging Face      | Unified process        | Fast, stable Linux container runtime |
+| Cloud (EC2, GPU)  | Unified process        | Standard production path             |
+
+---
+
+### Pre-retrieval Metadata Filtering
+
+- Filters (e.g., by gender, country, source_type) are applied to chunk metadata before FAISS search.
+- Supported in all retrieval modes (in-process and subprocess).
+- Improves efficiency and explainability.
+- Only output fields (e.g., chunk_id, text_snippet) are exposed to downstream consumers; internal metadata is not leaked.

 # Tests for Nobel Laureate Speech Explorer
 
-This directory contains unit tests for core extraction and parsing logic in the Nobel Laureate Speech Explorer project. All tests use `pytest` and static HTML/text fixtures—no live HTTP requests are made.
+## 🚦 Test Progress & Environment-Aware Execution (2025)
+
+- **Dual-process FAISS retrieval is now supported for Mac/Intel:**
+  - Set `export NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS=1` before running tests to avoid segfaults.
+  - On Linux/CI, leave this variable unset or set to `0` for faster, unified in-process tests.
+- **All tests are model-aware and config-driven.**
+- **Test coverage includes:**
+  - Extraction/parsing logic
+  - Intent classification and routing
+  - End-to-end RAG pipeline (dry run and live)
+  - Thematic expansion and chunk formatting
+
+**Helper for contributors:**
+```bash
+# On Mac/Intel (avoid segfaults):
+export NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS=1
+pytest
+
+# On Linux/CI (faster):
+export NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS=0  # or leave unset
+pytest
+```
+- You can also set this in test setup with `os.environ["NOBELLM_USE_FAISS_SUBPROCESS"] = "0"` for explicit control.
+- See the main README.md and rag/README.md for more details on the environment toggle and dual-mode retrieval logic.
+
+---
+
+## Model-Aware, Config-Driven Testing (NEW)
+
+All tests for chunking, embedding, and RAG are now **model-aware and config-driven**. The embedding model, FAISS index, and chunk metadata paths are centrally managed in `rag/model_config.py`:
+
+- Tests should use `get_model_config` to obtain model names, file paths, and dimensions.
+- Where relevant, tests should be parameterized to run for all supported models (e.g., MiniLM, BGE-Large).
+- This ensures that all code paths are robust to model switching and that outputs are correct for each model.
+- Avoid hardcoding file names, model names, or dimensions in tests—always use the config.
+
+**Example (pytest parametrize):**
+```python
+import pytest
+from rag.model_config import get_model_config
+
+@pytest.mark.parametrize("model_id", list(get_model_config().keys()))
+def test_chunking_output_schema(model_id):
+    config = get_model_config(model_id)
+    # Use config["model_name"], config["index_path"], etc.
+    # ... test logic ...
+```
+
+**To add a new model:**
+- Add its config to `rag/model_config.py`.
+- All model-aware tests will pick it up automatically.
+

 ### What is Tested?
 
-#### 1. `QueryRouter` (routing and metadata integration)
-- **Purpose:** Ensures queries are routed to the correct answer path (metadata or RAG) and that logs/fields are correct.
-- **Test Cases:**
-  - Factual queries matching metadata rules (should return `answer_type='metadata'` and correct answer)
-  - Factual queries not matching metadata rules (should return `answer_type='rag'`)
-  - No metadata provided (should return `answer_type='rag'`)
-  - Thematic and generative queries (should return `answer_type='rag'`)
-  - Logs and metadata_answer fields present and correct
-- **Inputs:** Query strings and static `EXAMPLE_METADATA` (see test file)
-- **Expected Output:** Correct routing, answer type, and logs
-
-#### 2. `PromptTemplateSelector` (prompt template selection)
-- **Purpose:** Ensures the correct prompt template is returned for thematic intent and that errors are raised for unknown intents.
-- **Test Cases:**
-  - Thematic intent returns the correct template with all key instructions
-  - Factual template is not returned for thematic intent
-  - ValueError is raised for unknown intent
-- **Inputs:** Intent strings ('thematic', 'unknown_intent')
-- **Expected Output:** Thematic template string for 'thematic', error for unknown
-
-#### 3. Context Formatting (if applicable)
-- **Purpose:** Ensures context is formatted as expected for thematic prompts, if a dedicated formatting helper exists.
-- **Test Cases:**
-  - Thematic context is formatted with all required fields and structure
-- **Inputs:** Retrieved context chunks for thematic queries
-- **Expected Output:** Properly formatted context string for the prompt
-- **Note:** Review if a dedicated formatting helper exists for thematic context; add or update tests as needed.
+- Fallback strategies (metadata to RAG)
+- Invalid intent input (raises ValueError)
+- Thematic/factual/generative routing
+- Logs, config, and prompt template selection
+- Missing/malformed filters in thematic routing
+- End-to-end pipeline integration (mocked)
+- All required unit tests present and passing
+
+#### 1. `extract_life_and_work_blurbs`
+# ... existing code ...
+
+#### 5. `test_end_to_end_thematic_and_factual_query`
+- **Purpose:** Integration test for the full pipeline for both thematic and factual queries (mocked retrieval and LLM). Also includes a placeholder for generative queries.
+- **Inputs:**
+  - Thematic query: "What are common themes in Nobel lectures?"
+  - Factual query: "What year did Toni Morrison win?"
+- **Expected Output:**
+  - Thematic: `answer_type` is 'rag', answer contains 'justice', source includes 'Toni Morrison'.
+  - Factual: `answer_type` is 'metadata', answer contains '1993', metadata includes 'Toni Morrison'.
+  - Generative: Placeholder for future implementation.

-- **Purpose:** Simulates the full thematic query pipeline, including routing, retrieval, prompt construction, and LLM call (mocked), to ensure the entire pipeline works as expected.
+#### 6. `test_answer_query_unit`
+- **Purpose:** Unit test for `answer_query`, mocking all dependencies to check output schema and correctness.
+- **Inputs:** Query string (e.g., "Who won the Nobel Prize in 2017?")
+- **Expected Output:**
+  - `answer_type` is 'metadata', answer contains '2017', metadata includes 'Kazuo Ishiguro'.
+
+#### 7. Multi-field filter propagation
+- **Purpose:** Ensures that when multiple filters (e.g., {"country": "USA", "source_type": "nobel_lecture"}) are passed, they are correctly propagated to the retriever. The test checks only output fields (e.g., chunk_id, text_snippet) in the final answer, not internal metadata fields, to align with privacy and output schema requirements.
 - **Test Cases:**
-  - Thematic query is routed, context is retrieved (mocked), prompt is constructed, and LLM call is made (mocked)
-  - Checks that the answer, sources, and answer_type are correct in the final output
-- **Inputs:** Thematic query string (e.g., "What are common themes in Nobel lectures?")
+  - Query with multiple filters
+- **Inputs:** Query string, filter dict with multiple fields
 - **Expected Output:**
-  - `answer_type` is 'rag'
-  - The answer contains expected thematic content (e.g., mentions "justice")
-  - Sources include correct metadata (e.g., laureate, text_snippet)
+  - All returned chunks have correct output fields (e.g., chunk_id, text_snippet) and match the expected output schema
+  - Internal metadata fields are not exposed in the output
+- **Status:** Test present and passing
 
-### 3. IntentClassifier (Unit)
-- **Status:** ✅ Fully implemented in `tests/test_intent_classifier.py`.
-- **Note:** All required unit tests for the IntentClassifier (factual, thematic, generative, precedence, case insensitivity, fallback, scoping) are present and comprehensive as of this review. No further action needed.
+## Test File: `test_retriever.py`
 
----
+### What is Tested?
 
-## Metadata Handler & Pattern Robustness
+- Retrieval with valid filters (mocked FAISS and metadata)
+- Handling of zero vector (raises ValueError)
+- Dual-process retriever returns results (mocked subprocess and file I/O)
+- Dual-process retriever handles subprocess error (raises RuntimeError)
+- query_index returns correct top_k results and metadata (mocked)
+- query_index raises FileNotFoundError if index is missing
+- All required unit tests present and passing
 
-All factual query patterns in the metadata handler are now robust to extra trailing context (e.g., "Nobel Prizes in Literature") and punctuation. The test suite covers all pattern variants, including those with additional phrasing at the end of the query. The metadata flattening utility is now in `rag/metadata_utils.py` for lightweight import in tests and other modules.
+## Test File: `test_metadata_handler.py`
 
-Test collection and execution is now fast due to modularization and lazy loading of heavy resources.
+### What is Tested?
 
-## How to Run the Tests
+- All factual query patterns and variants are covered
+- Edge cases for unknown laureate/country
+- Compound/nested filter logic is tested via manual filtering (handler does not natively support compound filters)
+- Fallbacks for zero matches are tested
+- Note: Handler should be updated to natively support compound filters for full coverage
+- All current required unit tests present and passing
 
-From the project root, activate your virtual environment and run:
+## Test File: `test_utils.py`
 
-```bash
-pytest
-```
+### What is Tested?
 
-Or to run only a specific test file:
+- format_chunks_for_prompt is fully tested
+- Covers: all metadata present, missing metadata fallback, custom template, empty chunk list, all metadata missing
+- All required unit tests present and passing
 
-```bash
-pytest tests/test_query_router.py
-```
+## Test File: `test_prompt_builder.py`
+- **Purpose:** Unit tests for prompt building logic. Ensures all fields and formatting are correct for all query types.
+- **Test Cases:** Factual, thematic, generative, edge cases (missing fields, empty chunks).
+- **Status:** All required unit tests present and passing.
 
-## Output
-- All tests should pass with no errors.
-- Output will be shown in the terminal by pytest (summary of passed/failed tests).
-- No files are written or modified by these tests.
+## Test File: `test_answer_compiler.py`
+- **Purpose:** Unit tests for answer compilation logic. Ensures output schema, answer content, and source formatting are correct.
+- **Test Cases:** RAG, metadata, hybrid, no relevant chunks.
+- **Status:** All required unit tests present and passing.
 
-## Adding More Tests
-- Add new test files for other modules as needed (e.g., `test_chunking.py`, `test_embeddings.py`).
-- Use static fixtures and avoid network calls for unit tests.
-- Follow the same style: docstrings, descriptive test names, and clear input/output expectations.
+## Test File: `test_e2e_frontend_contract.py`
+- **Purpose:** End-to-end test for user query → answer, validating the full output contract expected by the frontend.
+- **Test Cases:** Factual, thematic, generative, no results, empty query, error handling.
+- **Status:** All required E2E tests present and passing.
 
-## Test File: `test_theme_reformulator.py`
+## Test File: `test_retriever_to_query_index.py`
 
 ### What is Tested?
 
-#### 1. `expand_query_terms`
-- **Purpose:** Ensures that expansion includes canonical themes and all related keywords for a sample query, using lemmatization and theme mapping.
-- **Test Cases:**
-  - Query with multiple related theme keywords (e.g., "morality and truth")
-  - Checks that all canonical and related keywords for matched themes are included in the expansion.
-- **Inputs:** Sample queries containing theme-related words.
-- **Expected Output:** Set of expanded keywords including all canonical and related terms for the matched themes.
+- **Integration test for retrieve_chunks → query_index**
+- Ensures that retrieve_chunks calls query_index with correct arguments (embedding, top_k, filters, model_id)
+- Tests filter propagation (single and multi-field)
+- Handles no results (empty list)
+- Asserts output schema (required fields present)
+- **Score threshold filtering:** Only returns chunks above score_threshold unless fallback is triggered
+- **min_k fallback:** If too few chunks pass the threshold, returns at least min_k chunks
+- **Invalid embedding handling:** Raises ValueError for invalid (all-zeros) embedding
+- **Status:** All tests present and passing
 
-#### 2. `expand_query_terms` (parametric, all keywords)
-- **Purpose:** Ensures that for every theme and every keyword in `themes.json`, the expansion includes both the canonical theme and the original keyword.
-- **Test Cases:**
-  - For each theme and each keyword, query with that keyword and check expansion.
-- **Inputs:** All theme keywords from `themes.json`.
-- **Expected Output:** Expansion includes the canonical theme and the original keyword for every input.
+---
+
+## Test File: `test_prompt_template.py`
+- **Purpose:** Unit tests for PromptTemplateSelector. Ensures correct template is returned for each intent and that error handling is robust.
+- **Test Cases:** Factual, thematic, generative, unknown intent.
+- **Status:** All required unit tests present and passing.
+
+## Test File: `test_context_formatting.py`
+- **Purpose:** Unit tests for context formatting helpers. Ensures correct formatting for factual and thematic contexts.
+- **Test Cases:** All fields present, missing fields, custom templates.
+- **Status:** All required unit tests present and passing.
+
+## TODO: Model-Aware Test Coverage (Recommended)
+
+The following tests are recommended to ensure robust, model-aware coverage for the full pipeline:
+
+- **Chunking Output Tests:**
+  - Add `test_chunking.py` to validate the output schema and content of chunk files (`chunks_literature_labeled_{model}.jsonl`) for all supported models.
+  - Parameterize over all models using `get_model_config`.
+
+- **Embedding File Tests:**
+  - Add `test_embeddings.py` to check that embedding files (`literature_embeddings_{model}.json`) are present, have correct shape, and match the config dimension for each model.
+
+- **FAISS Index Build Tests:**
+  - Add `test_index_build.py` to verify that the FAISS index and metadata files exist, are readable, and have the correct dimension for each model.
+
+- **End-to-End RAG Pipeline Tests:**
+  - Add `test_rag_pipeline.py` to run a real (non-mocked) RAG query using the actual index and embeddings for at least one model, and check that results are returned and have the expected schema.
+
+- **General:**
+  - All new tests should use `get_model_config` and be parameterized for all supported models.
+  - Avoid hardcoding file names, model names, or dimensions in tests.
 
-- **Note:** Retrieval configuration for thematic queries (i.e., `RetrievalConfig(top_k=15, score_threshold=None)`) is explicitly checked in the comprehensive thematic routing test (`test_router_thematic_query_comprehensive`), so no separate test is needed for this logic. 
\ No newline at end of file
+These additions will ensure the codebase is robust to model switching and that all outputs are correct for each supported model.
