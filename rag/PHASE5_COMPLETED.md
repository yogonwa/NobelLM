## 📊 **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Metadata-Aware Chunk Formatting**
- **Visual Markers**: 🎓 for lectures, 🏅 for ceremonies, 📚 for general
- **Citation Styles**: Inline `(Author, Year)`, footnote `[1] Author, Year`, full citations
- **Metadata Integration**: Laureate name, year, speech type, category

### **2. Intent-Specific Templates**
- **QA Templates**: Factual, analytical, comparative queries
- **Generative Templates**: Email, speech, reflection tasks
- **Thematic Templates**: Exploration, cross-cultural, temporal analysis
- **Scoped Templates**: Laureate-specific, work-specific queries

### **3. Smart Prompt Building**

## 🎯 **Example Outputs**

### **QA Prompt Example**
```
Answer the following question about Nobel Literature laureates: What did Toni Morrison say about language?

Context:
[🎓 Lecture — Toni Morrison, 1993] Language can never pin down slavery, genocide, war. Nor can it describe the depths of human experience. (Toni Morrison, 1993)

[🏅 Ceremony — Gabriel García Márquez, 1982] The solitude of Latin America has a long history of violence and injustice, but also of resilience and hope. (Gabriel García Márquez, 1982)
```

### **Generative Email Prompt Example**
```
You are a Nobel laureate responding to a professional opportunity. Draft a job acceptance email in the style of a Nobel Prize winner

Use the following excerpts as inspiration for your response:
[🎓 Lecture — Toni Morrison, 1993] Language can never pin down slavery, genocide, war. Nor can it describe the depths of human experience. (Toni Morrison, 1993)

Write in the style of a Nobel laureate with appropriate humility, gratitude, and sense of responsibility. Structure your response as a formal email.
```

### **Thematic Prompt Example**
```
Explore the theme of 'How do Nobel laureates discuss the role of literature in society?' using the following Nobel laureate perspectives:
[🎓 Lecture — Toni Morrison, 1993] Language can never pin down slavery, genocide, war. Nor can it describe the depths of human experience. (Toni Morrison, 1993)

Provide a comprehensive analysis with diverse viewpoints, historical context, and contemporary relevance.
