"""
Integration test: Prompt builder â†’ answer compiler
Ensures that all sources are included in the prompt and the final answer references the correct context.

Aligned with current architecture:
- Calls format_chunks_for_prompt() to build context string from chunks
- Calls build_prompt() with (query, context)
- Asserts that chunk texts, laureate names, years, source types, and user query are all present
