Exploring Nobel Prize Speeches with AI: A Behind-the-Scenes Look
Imagine being able to ask questions like:

“What themes do American Nobel Literature winners tend to focus on in their speeches?”
“How have women laureates described their work over the years?”

The Nobel Laureate Speech Explorer is a project I’m building to make this possible. At its heart is a system that blends traditional information retrieval with modern AI language models — a method called RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

What Is This Project About?
The project collects and analyzes the speeches, bios, and award notes of Nobel Prize winners in Literature. For each laureate, I extract:

Their Nobel Lecture (the main speech)

Their Acceptance Speech

The Committee’s Statement about why they won

Plus structured data like name, country, language, and year

Then, using AI, the system breaks these texts into smaller passages and stores them in a searchable format. This lets you ask big, nuanced questions — and get answers pulled from the actual source material.

How Does Semantic Search Work?
Let’s say you ask:

“How do laureates talk about childhood in their lectures?”

With a traditional search engine, you'd get results only if the exact word “childhood” appeared in the text. But what if someone used “early years” or “formative experiences” instead?

This is where semantic search shines.

Instead of matching exact words, the system looks for meaning.

How? With Embeddings and Vectors
Here’s the magic trick behind the scenes:

Every passage of text is converted into a list of numbers — called a vector embedding. Think of it like plotting the passage on a map of meaning.

The user's question is also turned into a vector and plotted on the same map.

The system finds the nearest passages to the question — based on meaning, not just words.

This means it can surface speeches that use completely different wording but express similar ideas. For example, it might find a passage about “youth” or “growing up” even if you asked about “childhood.”

What Happens After That?
Once the system finds the most relevant passages, it hands them to an AI language model like GPT — which reads them and answers your question in natural language, citing the original sources.

This approach — combining AI’s language ability with your own curated knowledge — is called Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It’s like giving the AI a custom reference book and asking it to explain what it finds inside.

Why I’m Building This
This project is part learning tool, part literary explorer. I wanted to deepen my understanding of modern AI systems by building something real — and I’ve always loved literature and public speeches. Nobel lectures are often profound, and this tool gives us new ways to search across decades of thought, language, and creativity.

Stay tuned — I’ll be opening this up for public exploration once the prototype is ready.

Tech Sidebar: How Semantic Search Actually Works
At the heart of this project is a technique called vector-based semantic search. Here's how it works in a nutshell:

1. Chunking the Content
Every speech is broken into smaller passages — called chunks — typically 300–500 words each. This keeps things digestible and helps the AI focus on just a slice of content when answering a question.

Each chunk is also tagged with metadata like:

Who said it

What kind of speech it is (e.g., lecture or acceptance)

When and why it was given

2. Embedding the Chunks
Each chunk is then passed through a sentence embedding model, which converts the passage into a vector — a long list of numbers that represents the meaning of the text in a mathematical space.

Think of this as mapping meaning into coordinates on a huge multi-dimensional landscape.

3. Storing Vectors in FAISS
These vectors are stored in a special database called a vector index, using a library called FAISS (from Facebook AI Research). FAISS makes it lightning-fast to search for nearby vectors — meaning, it can quickly find the chunks that are most similar to your question.

4. Semantic Search in Action
When you ask a question like:

“What themes do American authors explore in their Nobel lectures?”

Here’s what happens:

Your question is embedded into a vector

The system finds the chunks that are closest to that vector (based on cosine similarity)

The top matching passages are fed into an LLM like GPT-3.5

GPT reads the source material and writes a natural-language answer — citing what it found

Why It Works
This approach allows the system to match ideas, not just keywords. A passage about “coming of age” might still be retrieved even if you never used the word “childhood.”

It’s like building a custom search engine where meaning matters more than wording — and where every answer is grounded in real human speech.
